import ApiReference from "@site/src/components/ApiReference";
import config from "../configs/profiles/replace";
import makeMetaDescription from "../configs/makeMetaDescription";

# PUT /profiles/:recipient_id

<head>
  <meta name="description" content={makeMetaDescription({description: config.description, path: config.path})} />
</head>

When using `PUT`, be sure to include all the key-value pairs required by the recipient's profile. Any key-value pairs that exist in the profile but fail to be included in the `PUT` request will be removed from the profile. Remember, a `PUT` update is a full replacement of the data. For partial updates, use the [PATCH /profiles/{recipient_id}](../../reference/profiles/patch.mdx) request.

### More Examples

The following types of requests will clear out the properties of the Profile:

```json title=JSON
// Empty Profile Object
{
  "profile": {}
}
```

The above will result with:

```json title=200
{
  "status": "SUCCESS"
}
```

The Profile will now be:

```json title=JSON
{
  "profile: {}
}
```

<ApiReference {...config} />
