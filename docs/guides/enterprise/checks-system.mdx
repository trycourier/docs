# Checks System

Checks System enables Courier customers to enable one or more checks that can be associated with multiple Courier features. As of now, we have checks configurable for the templates/notifications which is set to "custom".
[Internationalization Specification](internationalization-specification) has an example on how custom check can be leveraged for template translations workflow.

## Fetching Checks

Checks API GET endpoint

`GET /notifications/:notification_id/:submission_id/checks`

Example - `GET /notifications/SFTYJKSF0241SVH2TWY97TTFFTQG/1630424150210/checks`

```json
{
  "checks": [
    {
      "id": "custom",
      "status": "PENDING",
      "type": "custom",
      "updated": 1630424150210
    }
  ]
}
```

## Updating Checks

Once all content has been updated, Courier can be notified that the process is completed and release the template to be published.

`PUT /notifications/:notification_id/:submission_id/checks`

```json
{
  "checks": [
    {
      "status": "RESOLVED"
    }
  ]
}
```
