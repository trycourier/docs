# Outbound Webhooks

_*Outbound Webhooks are currently in beta.*_

Courier can use webhooks to notify your application when an event happens in your account. Currently, only message events are available for delivery via webhook.

## Add a new Webhook Destination

- Visit [https://app.courier.com/settings/webhooks](https://app.courier.com/settings/webhooks)
- Click `**Add Webhook**`
- Enter new Webhook destination information (this should accept a `POST` request)

## Handling Requests from Courier

**Read the event data**

Courier sends the event data in the request body. Each event is structured as an object with a **`type`** and related resource nested under **`data`**.

**Handle the event**

Currently, only `message:updated` events are supported. In the future, other event types will become available (eg: `profile:updated`).

**Return a 200 response**

Send a successful 200 response to Courier as quickly as possible. Write any long-running processes as code that can run asynchronously outside the webhook endpoint.

## Verifying signature

Verify the events that Courier sends to your webhook endpoints. Courier can optionally sign the webhook events it sends to your endpoints by including a signature in each event's `courier-signature` header. This allows you to verify that the events were sent by Courier, not by a third party.

```
t=1631816343012,signature=33777cdae0468ff0939b3609d02d14e6e80ca093c2ea233455f0767055218875
```

Courier generates signatures using a hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) with SHA-256.

### Step 1: Extract the timestamp and signatures from the header

Split the header, using the `,` character as the separator, to get a list of elements. Then split each element, using the = character as the separator, to get a prefix and value pair.

The value for the prefix t corresponds to the timestamp, and the signature corresponds to the signature

Before you can verify signatures, you need to retrieve your endpoint’s secret from your [Webhooks settings](https://app.courier.com/settings/webhooks), by clicking on a webhook configuration.

### Step 2: Prepare the signed_payload string

The signed_payload string is created by concatenating:

The timestamp (as a string)
The actual JSON payload (i.e., the request body)

### Step 3: Determine the expected signature

Compute an HMAC with the SHA256 hash function. Use the Courier webhook secret as the key, and use the payload string as the message.

```js title=TypeScript
const examplePayload = {
  data: {
    enqueued: 1631833955972,
    event: 'SNKDF4GZK94M0NHXBJQDF8GAQWM1',
    id: '1-6143cf63-4f27670f6304f465462695f2',
    providers: [],
    recipient: 'c156665c-a76c-4440-9676-f25c1b04ba93',
    status: 'ENQUEUED',
  },
  type: 'message:updated',
};

function parseHeader(header) {
  if (typeof header !== 'string') {
    return null;
  }

  return header.split(',')
    .reduce(
      (accum, item) => {
        const kv = item.split('=');

        if (kv[0] === 't') {
          accum.timestamp = kv[1];
        }
        if (kv[0] === 'signature') {
          accum.signature = kv[1];
        }

        return accum;
      },
      {
        timestamp: -1,
        signature: '',
      }
    );
}
// headers refers to the request headers from incoming webhook event from Courier
const headerDetails = parseHeader(headers['courier-signature']);

const unfoldedSignature = crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', secret)
    .update(`${headerDetails.timestamp}.${JSON.stringify(examplePayload)}`, 'utf8')
    .digest('hex');
}


const isValid = unfoldedSignature === headerDetails.signature;
```

### Step 4: Compare the signatures

Compare the signature (or signatures) in the header to the expected signature. For an equality match, compute the difference between the current timestamp and the received timestamp, then decide if the difference is within your tolerance.

To protect against timing attacks, use constant-time string comparison to compare the expected signature to each of the received signatures.

## Data

### message:updated

The `data` property in the webhook response payload for the `message:updated` event is identical to the information that is returned from the [GET /message/{message_id}](../../reference/messages/by-id.mdx) endpoint

For instance, when we send an email - it goes from ENQUEUED → SENT → DELIVERED → OPENED.

Here's a rundown for how the payloads would look like -

**Example payload for an ENQUEUED event**

```json title=JSON
{
  "data": {
    "enqueued": 1630512466717,

    "id": "<NOTIFICATION_ID>",
    "submission_id": 1620095270807 // submission ID is a timestamp of submission
  },
  "type": "notification:submitted"
}
```

### notification:submission_canceled
