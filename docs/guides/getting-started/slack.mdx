# Set Up Chat Using Slack

## Introduction

This step-by-step guide will walk you through sending a Slack Direct Message using Courier. You will:

<TOCInline toc={toc.slice(1)} />

### Prerequisites

You will need both Courier and Slack accounts to complete this tutorial. If you don't have accounts already, sign up before proceeding. You will also need permission to create a Slack app, configure that app, and add it to a Slack workspace. If you do not have access already, you can create your own free Slack workspace.

- [Sign up for Courier](https://app.courier.com/signup)
- [Sign up for Slack](https://slack.com/get-started)
- [Create a Slack Workspace](https://slack.com/create#email)

## Add the Slack Integration

Once logged in to Courier, navigate to the ["Integrations" page](https://app.courier.com/integrations). Click on the Slack Integration to configure it.

<Image img={require("../../assets/guides/slack/integration.png")} alt="Courier Slack Integration" />

Courier Integrations each require different pieces of information based on the needs of the Integration provider. We will send our configuration details as part of our request body when sending a message. For now, click "Install."

### Slack App

Our Slack app will be relatively simple. Slack allows for complex interactivity and menu interactions. For a full overview of what's possible, visit ["An Introduction to Slack Apps"](https://api.slack.com/start/overview). We will create an app that delivers direct messages only. If you would like to use an existing Slack App, you can skip to [OAuth Permissions](#oauth-permissions).

#### Create a Slack App

Once logged in to Slack, navigate to the ["Apps"](https://api.slack.com/apps) page, and click the "Create an App" button. This will open a modal with two form fields: "App Name," and "Slack Development Workspace."

<Image img={require("../../assets/guides/slack/create-app.png")} alt="Create a Slack App" />

For the "App Name," use something like "Courier Test App." The "Development Slack Workspace" drop-down should display Slack workspaces where you are authenticated. Select the workspace you will be using to build this app. Then, click "Create App."

<Image img={require("../../assets/guides/slack/app-console.png")} alt="Slack App Console" />

#### OAuth Permissions

For this tutorial, we'll be sending a direct message using the email address associated with the recipient's Slack account. To do this, your app will need the following scopes: `chat:write`, `im:write`, `users:read`, and `users:read.email`. Navigate to the "OAuth & Permissions" page in the sidebar menu. In the Scopes section of the page, add these scopes as Bot Token Scopes.

<Image img={require("../../assets/guides/slack/oauth-scopes.png")} alt="Slack OAuth Scopes" />

At the top of this page is a button labeled "Install App to Workspace" or "Reinstall App" if you're using an existing Slack App. Click this button.

<Image img={require("../../assets/guides/slack/install-app.png")} alt="Slack OAuth & Permissions" />

You should see a "Bot User OAuth Access Token." Make note of this value.

Congratulations, you've configured your Integration with Slack. Now, let's create a Notification.

## Create a Courier Notification

Navigate to the Courier ["Notifications" page](https://app.courier.com/designer/notifications) and click "Create Notification." Click on “Untitled Notification” to rename your notification — for this tutorial, call it “Test Appointment Reminder.” From your list of configured Integrations, click on the Slack button. Then, click the “Slack” box that has been added to the sidebar in order to bring up a Slack template.

<Image
  img={require("../../assets/guides/slack/courier-notification-template.png")}
  alt="Courier Notification Template"
/>

Courier provides a visual template editor, so you can send notifications that are formatted professionally. You can add content blocks to the template by clicking appropriate icons. If you remove a content block, it is moved to your Library in the sidebar and can be dragged back to the template if necessary.

These content blocks can include variables using a mustache-like template syntax. Surround text with a single set of curly braces and that text will be interpreted as a variable (it will also be highlighted in green). For example, you may want to include a `{name}` variable (we'll cover the source of this variable data later in this tutorial).

For now, add a text block and fill it with whatever text you want to send. You can also copy the example below, which contains a few variables for demonstration.

```text title=Text
Hello {name},

This is an appointment reminder from Courier. We look forward to seeing you on {apt_date} at {apt_time}.

If you need to change your appointment for any reason, please contact us at least 24 hours in advance at {support_url} or {support_phone}.

Best regards,

Courier
```

/>

When you are finished, click Publish in the upper right corner and give it a Publish Message of "Initial notification."

## Send a Message

Courier passes messages to Integrations via the [Send endpoint](../../reference/send/message.mdx). For this tutorial, we will send our messages with cURL, but you can use your preferred language and HTTP library. You can also use an API testing tool such as [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/). For additional code samples, see the ["Courier API Reference"](../../reference/intro.mdx).

### Authorization

Courier supports both basic and token authorization. For this tutorial, we will use token authorization. You can read more about authorization in Courier's ["Authorization Overview"](../../reference/authorization.mdx).

We must send an `Authorization` header with each request. The Courier Send API also requires an `event`. The authorization token and event values are the "Auth Token" and "Notification ID" we see in the detail view of our “Test Appointment Reminder” event. Click the gear icon next to the Notification's name to reveal them.

<Image
  img={require("../../assets/guides/slack/auth-credentials.png")}
  alt="Courier Authorization Credentials"
/>

As a best practice, let's assign these values to environment variables. In a Bash terminal, you can add the variables by typing `VARIABLE_NAME="<value>"`. Some examples are provided below. Note that the values are just examples. Do not copy them — be sure to use the tokens associated with your account instead.

**Courier Auth Token Variable**

```shell
COURIER_AUTH_TOKEN="YpW2yEaMDyNg6agN9yGkc9ycEg8MxiKVTiiu2WVc8"
```

**Notification ID**

```shell
COURIER_NOTIFICATION_ID="YpW2yEaMDyNg6agN9yGkc9ycEg8"
```

These variables will persist for as long as your Bash session remains alive. If you quit your terminal, you will need to recreate them. However you handle your authorization tokens, keep them secure, and never add them to source control.

To verify that you created the variables correctly, you can see them by typing `echo $VARIABLE_NAME`. For example, typing `echo $COURIER_AUTH_TOKEN` will print the Courier Auth Token value to the terminal.

### Building the cURL Request

We want to send a POST request to `https://api.courier.com/send`. Let's build our cURL request line-by-line. First, we'll tell cURL this is a POST request.

```bash
curl --request POST
```

Next, add the `Authorization` header using the `COURIER_AUTH_TOKEN` variable we set earlier. We send this as a Bearer token.

```bash
curl --request POST \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $COURIER_AUTH_TOKEN" \
```

We also have a `Content-Type` header, which is `application/json`.

```bash
curl --request POST \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $COURIER_AUTH_TOKEN" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
```

We will pass the body of our request using the cURL `--data` option. You will often send this data in JSON format. To improve working with cURL, Courier also supports a custom urlencoded format that can be used in the place of JSON. This format allows nested data values using square bracket syntax. This guide provides examples in both formats, so feel free to use the format that you like best.

Our `--data` option must also contain an `event` and `recipient`. Additionally, we will send `profile` and `data` objects.

The `event` value, for this example, is the "Notification ID" that we assigned to our `COURIER_NOTIFICATION_ID` environment variable earlier.

A `recipient` should be a unique identifier that does not change. This prevents duplicate entries in the event that a recipient changes their email or some other identifying value. We do not have any recipients in this tutorial, so we can enter any string value. Something like `“spike_spiegel”` will work.

The `profile` information is an object that includes any key-value pairs required by our Integrations. In the case of Slack, we need the "Bot User OAuth Access Token" and "Email associated with the recipient's Slack Account." These are sent as `access_token` and `email` respectively in a `slack` object. You can find the required keys for any Integration by selecting an Integration on the ["Integrations" page](../providers/intro.mdx).

Lastly, we define message variables inside the `data` object. Remember the variables we set in the visual template editor? This is where we provide the values. Our example message had `name`, `apt_date`, `apt_time`, `support_phone`, and `support_url` variables. For this tutorial, we can assign example strings to each.

Our `--data` object should look like this:

<Tabs groupId="code">
<TabItem value="json" label="JSON">

```json
{
  "event": "'"$COURIER_NOTIFICATION_ID"'",
  "recipient": "spike_spiegel",
  "profile": {
    "slack": {
      "access_token": "xoxb-487947363398-212718859602-bXYRRbrQHAijFnfnuKLM7JV1",
      "email": "spiegel@bebop.com"
    }
  },
  "data": {
    "name": "Spike Spiegel",
    "apt_date": "June 26",
    "apt_time": "8:44 PM",
    "support_phone": "555-555-5555",
    "support_url": "https://courier.com/docs"
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="bash" label="cURL urlencoded">

```bash
--data "event=$COURIER_NOTIFICATION_ID" \
--data "recipient=spike_spiegel" \
--data "profile[slack][access_token]=xoxb-487947363398-212718859602-bXYRRbrQHAijFnfnuKLM7JV1" \
--data "profile[slack][email]=spiegel@bebop.com" \
--data "data[name]=Spike Spiegel" \
--data "data[apt_date]=June 26" \
--data "data[apt_time]=8:44 PM" \
--data "data[support_phone]=555-555-5555" \
--data "data[support_url]=https://www.courier.com/docs/" \
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now add the Send URL, `https://api.courier.com/send`, to complete the cURL request.

#### Complete cURL Request in both Formats

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="bash" label="cURL in JSON">

```bash
curl --request POST \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $COURIER_AUTH_TOKEN" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{
  "event": "'"$COURIER_NOTIFICATION_ID"'",
  "recipient": "spike_spiegel",
  "profile": {
    "slack": {
      "access_token": "xoxb-487947363398-212718859602-bXYRRbrQHAijFnfnuKLM7JV1",
      "email": "spiegel@bebop.com"
    }
  },
 "data":  {
    "name": "Spike Spiegel",
    "apt_date": "June 26",
    "apt_time": "8:44 PM",
    "support_phone": "555-555-5555",
    "support_url": "https://courier.com/docs"
   }
 }' \
https://api.courier.com/send
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="bash-urlencoded" label="cURL urlencoded">

```bash
curl --request POST \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $COURIER_AUTH_TOKEN" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data "event=$COURIER_NOTIFICATION_ID" \
--data "recipient=spike_spiegel" \
--data "profile[slack][access_token]=xoxb-487947363398-212718859602-bXYRRbrQHAijFnfnuKLM7JV1" \
--data "profile[slack][email]=spiegel@bebop.com" \
--data "data[name]=Spike Spiegel" \
--data "data[apt_date]=June 26" \
--data "data[apt_time]=8:44 PM" \
--data "data[support_phone]=555-555-5555" \
--data "data[support_url]=https://www.courier.com/docs/" \
https://api.courier.com/send
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Before sending this request, be sure to replace the `access_token` and `email` values with the Bot User OAuth Access Token and recipient's Slack Email. Also, note the `"'"$COURIER_NOTIFICATION_ID"'"` formatting in the JSON formatted `--data` option. The quotes are necessary to escape the JSON quotes and access the `COURIER_NOTIFICATION_ID` variable.

Paste your complete cURL request in either format in your terminal and hit "Return." You should receive a response like `{"messageId":"<message id string>"}`. You will also receive a Slack message from your Slack app.
