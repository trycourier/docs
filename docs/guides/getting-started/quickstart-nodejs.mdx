# Nodejs Quickstart

Welcome to the Node.js Quickstart! Here we will walk through the process of finding our API keys, installing the SDK, and making your first API call with Node.js. If you have any questions, join our Discourse community: [https://forum.courier.com/](https://forum.courier.com/)

## Prerequisites

- Sign up for Courier
- Install the latest version of nodejs: [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Getting Your API Keys

Navigate to the Courier app [https://app.courier.com/](https://app.courier.com/) to get access to all API keys, including production and test keys. [Learn more about the difference between production and test keys >](https://forum.courier.com/t/the-difference-between-production-and-test-environments/115)

After signing up, click on the setting icon ⚙️ at the bottom left of the Courier app and click "API Keys" in the left menu. For this you can use either the Published Test or the Published Production keys. You can switch between the Production and Test environments at the top right corner of the app.

## Installing the SDK

Install dependensies:

```
npm install node-fetch --save
```

Run the following command in your project directory to install the SDK via npm:

```
npm install @trycourier/courier
```

## Send Your Notification

```jsx
const fetch = require('node-fetch');

const options = {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    Accept: 'application/json',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    "message": {
      "to": {
        "data": {},
        "preferences": {}
      },
      "routing": {
        "method": "single",
        "channels": []
      },
      "channels": {},
      "providers": {},
      "metadata": {},
      "template": "NOTIFICATION_TEMPLATE"
    }
  })
};

fetch('https://api.courier.com/send', options)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(response => console.log(response))
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
```

Replace the JSON within the body to match the type and content of notification you want to send.

### Create a Notification: API V2

Courier Elemental is a new JSON syntax built to describe your notification, including recipient data, notification content, variables, and routing. Here is an example of a simple notification sent with Elemental:

```json
{
	"message": {
		"to": {
			"email": "email@example.com",
			"user_id": "user-12345"
		},
		"content": {
			"title": "Welcome!",
			"body": "Thanks for signing up, {{name}}"
		},
		"data": {
			"name": "Peter Parker"
		},
		"routing": {
			"method": "single",
			"channels": ["email"]
		}
	}
}
```

### Create a Notification: In the Designer

For this step, you will first need to create a notification template in your Courier app. [Learn how to design your first notification >](https://youtu.be/lvhRdNJMLbY) Get your Notification ID by going to the notification settings, under the General category.

Send a message using a notification template from your Courier app:

```json
{
	"message": {
		"to": {
			"email": "email@example.com",
			"user_id": "user-12345"
		},
		"notification-template": "a-courier-notification-id-or-event-mapping"
	}
}
```

### Send & Test the Notification

Sending a message is an async process. So upon submission of a message, only a requestId will be returned.

```json
{ "requestId": "87e7c05b-4f46-fda24e356e23" }
```

Monitor the status of your notification once sent in the Courier app's [Data Dashboard](https://app.courier.com/data/messages).
