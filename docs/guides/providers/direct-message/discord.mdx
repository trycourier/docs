# Discord

## Discord Bot Requirements

To send notifications via Discord, a Discord Bot is required. You may use an existing or [create a new basic bot](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro).

### Scopes

When you create the install link for your bot, make sure it has the `bot` scope with at least `View Channels` and `Send Messages` permissions. If you would like to send a message as a reply to another message, your bot will also need the `Read Message History` permission.

## Profiles Requirements

The information required in the recipient profile is different based on the type of message you are sending.

### Sending a Direct Message

To send a message to a user, you'll need to supply the discord profile object with a `user_id`. This is not the user tag. You can retrieve this value using the Discord API or copying it from a Discord Client in [Developer mode](https://discordia.me/en/developer-mode). The user you are trying to message must be a member of a server the bot is installed in.

```json title=JSON
// Recipient Profile
{
  "discord": {
    "user_id": "617099137532932107"
  }
}
```

### Sending a Message to a Channel

To send a message to a channel, you'll need to supply the discord profile object with a `channel_id`. You can retrieve this value using the Discord API or copying it from a Discord Client in [Developer mode](https://discordia.me/en/developer-mode). The bot must be installed in the server to send to the channel.

```json title=JSON
// Recipient Profile
{
  "discord": {
    "channel_id": "768866348853383208"
  }
}
```

## Override

You can use a provider override to replace what we send to Discord's [Create Message](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/channel#create-message) endpoint. For example, you can choose to an an embed.

```json title=JSON
{
  "event": "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ",
  "recipient": "CHANNEL_GENERAL",
  "profile": {
    "discord": {
      "channel_id": "768866348853383208"
    }
  },
  "override": {
    "discord": {
      "body": {
        "embed": {
          "title": "Hello, Embed!",
          "description": "This is an embedded message."
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
