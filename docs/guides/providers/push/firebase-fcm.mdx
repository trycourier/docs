# Firebase FCM

## Configuration Requirements

You can get your `Service Account JSON` by following [these instructions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/auth-server#provide_credentials_manually). Paste the complete contents of the JSON file you download from Firebase into the configuration field.

## Profile Requirements

To deliver a message to a recipient over Firebase FCM, Courier must be
provided the recipient's [Firebase registration token](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/js/first-message#access_the_registration_token). This token should be included in the recipient profile as `firebaseToken`.

```json title=JSON
{
  "firebaseToken": "MTI2MjAwMzQ3OTMzQHByb2plY3RzLmdjbS5hbmFTeUIzcmNaTmtmbnFLZEZiOW1oekNCaVlwT1JEQTJKV1d0dw=="
}
```

## Override

You can use a provider override to replace what we send to the Firebase FCM API. For example, you can provide an [optional data](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/fcm/rest/v1/projects.messages#Message) override. If you are overriding `body`, Courier will send the supplied `body` as message payload at the request time to FCM. If you want to change part of the message, you can supply those in the `data` bag in JSON and use [template variables](/docs/platform/content/using-variables/inserting-variables/) to change the message content dynamically.

```json title=JSON
{
  "event": "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ",
  "recipient": "abc123",
  "profile": {
    "firebaseToken": "MTI2MjAwMzQ3OTMzQHByb2plY3RzLmdjbS5hbmFTeUIzcmNaTmtmbnFLZEZiOW1oekNCaVlwT1JEQTJKV1d0dw=="
  },
  "override": {
    "firebase-fcm": {
      "body": {
        "notification": {
          "title": "Portugal vs. Denmark",
          "body": "great match!"
        },
        "data": {
          "Nick": "Mario",
          "Room": "PortugalVSDenmark"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Everything inside of `override.firebase-fcm.body` will be merged into the [Message object](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/fcm/rest/v1/projects.messages#Message) we send to the Firebase FCM API.

## Tracking Events

Courier will include tracking URL information in the `data` attribute on the incoming message payload.
