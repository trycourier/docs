# Pusher

## Profile Requirements

To deliver a message to a recipient via Pusher, Courier must be provided a target object that contains the recipient's pusher channel. This value should be included in the recipient profile as 'pusher'.

```json title=JSON
// Recipient Profile
{
  "pusher": {
    "channel": "<PUSHER_CHANNEL>"
  }
}
```

## Template Requirements

Pusher can be used in Courier in two ways. One is via the "Push" channel the other is via a direct Pusher channel. When in the direct Pusher channel, a jsonnet editor will be provided for you to customize your payload. When Pusher is integrated via the push channel, a rich editor will be shown.

## Example Event

```json title=JSON
{
  "event": "<COURIER_NOTIFICATION_ID>",
  "recipient": "katherine_pryde",
  "profile": {
    "pusher": {
      "channel": "<PUSHER_CHANNEL>"
    }
  },
  "data": {
    "name": "Katherine Pryde"
  }
}
```

## Tracking Events

Courier will include tracking URL information in the `data` attribute on the incoming message payload.

See [Courier push notification tracking](../push/intro.mdx#tracking)
