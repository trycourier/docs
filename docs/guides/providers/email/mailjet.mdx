# Mailjet

## Profile Requirements

To deliver a message to a recipient over Mailjet, Courier must be provided the recipient's email address. This value should be included in the recipient profile as `email`.

```json title=JSON
// Recipient Profile
{
  "email": "example@example.com"
}
```

## Override

You can use a provider override to replace what we send to Mailjet's Send API. For example, you can add an attachment to your request:

```json title=JSON
{
  "event": "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ",
  "recipient": "abc123",
  "profile": {
    "email": "example@example.com"
  },
  "override": {
    "mailjet": {
      "body": {
        "Attachments": [
          {
            "ContentType": "text/plain",
            "Filename": "test.txt",
            "content": "VGhpcyBpcyB5b3VyIGF0dGFjaGVkIGZpbGUhISEK"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Everything inside of `override.mailjet` will replace what we send to Mailjet's Send API. You can see all the available options by visiting [Mailjet API docs](https://dev.mailjet.com/email/guides/send-api-V3/).
