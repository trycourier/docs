# Amply

## Profile Requirements

To deliver a message to a recipient over Amply, Courier must be provided the recipient's email address. This value should be included in the recipient profile as `email`.

```json title=JSON
// Recipient Profile
{
  "email": "example@example.com"
}
```

## Override

You can use a provider override to replace what we send to Amply's Mail Send API. For example, you can use following payload to override `from email` with your request:

```json title=JSON
{
  "event": "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ",
  "recipient": "abc123",
  "profile": {
    "email": "example@example.com"
  },
  "override": {
    "amply": {
      "config": [
        {
          "fromEmail": "pigeons@courier.com"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Everything inside of `override.amply` will replace what we send to Amply's Send Mail API. You can see all the available options by visiting [Amply API docs](https://docs.sendamply.com/docs/api/b3A6MTg2OTcyNA-send-an-email).

## Sending Attachments

To include an attachment in the email, you can use the following override:

```json
{
  "event": "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ",
  "recipient": "abc123",
  "profile": {
    "email": "example@example.com"
  },
  "data": {
    "hello": "world"
  },
  "override": {
    "amply": {
      "attachments": [
        {
          "filename": "billing.pdf",
          "contentType": "application/pdf",
          "data": "Q29uZ3JhdHVsYXRpb25zLCB5b3UgY2FuIGJhc2U2NCBkZWNvZGUh"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
