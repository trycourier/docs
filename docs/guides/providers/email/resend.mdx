# Resend

## Profile Requirements

To deliver a message to a recipient over Resend, Courier must be provided the recipient's email address. This value should be included in the recipient profile as `email`.

```json title=JSON
// Recipient Profile
{
  "email": "example@example.com"
}
```

## Override

You can use a provider override to replace what we send to Resend's Email API. For example, you can use [Resend's Tagging](https://resend.com/docs/api-reference/emails/send-email) with your request:

```json title=JSON
{
  "message": {
    "template": "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ",
    "to": {
      "email": "example@example.com"
    },
    "providers": {
      "resend": {
        "override": {
          "body": {
            "tags": [{ "name": "environment", "value": "development" }]
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `override.resend` can be used to replace what we send to Resend's Email API. Note: the override does not replace the entire object, only the elements that you define in the body of the override. You can see all the available options by visiting the [Resend API docs](https://resend.com/docs/api-reference/emails/send-email).
