# SparkPost

## Profile Requirements

To deliver a message to a recipient over SparkPost, Courier must be provided the recipient's email address. This value should be included in the recipient profile as `email`.

```json title=JSON
// Recipient Profile
{
  "email": "example@example.com"
}
```

## Override

You can use a provider override to replace what we send to SparkPost's Transmissions API. For example, you can add an attachment to your request:

```json title=JSON
{
  "event": "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ",
  "recipient": "abc123",
  "profile": {
    "email": "example@example.com"
  },
  "override": {
    "sparkpost": {
      "body": {
        "content": {
          "attachments": [
            {
              "name": "billing.pdf",
              "type": "application/pdf",
              "data": "Q29uZ3JhdHVsYXRpb25zLCB5b3UgY2FuIGJhc2U2NCBkZWNvZGUh"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Everything inside of `override.sparkpost` will replace what we send to SparkPost's Transmissions API. You can see all the available options by visiting [SparkPost API docs](https://developers.sparkpost.com/api/transmissions/#header-request-body).
