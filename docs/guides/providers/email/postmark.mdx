# Postmark

## Profile Requirements

To deliver a message to a recipient over Postmark, Courier must be provided the recipient's email address. This value should be included in the recipient profile as `email`.

```json title=JSON
// Recipient Profile
{
  "email": "example@example.com"
}
```

## Override

You can use a provider override to replace what we send to Postmark's Email API. For example, you can add an attachment to your request:

```json title=JSON
{
  "event": "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ",
  "recipient": "abc123",
  "profile": {
    "email": "example@example.com"
  },
  "override": {
    "postmark": {
      "body": {
        "Attachments": [
          {
            "Name": "readme.txt",
            "Content": "dGVzdCBjb250ZW50",
            "ContentType": "text/plain"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `override.postmark` can be used to replace what we send to Postmark's Email API. Note: the override does not replace the entire object, only the elements that you define in the body of the override. You can see all the available options by visiting the [Postmark API docs](https://postmarkapp.com/developer/api/email-api).
