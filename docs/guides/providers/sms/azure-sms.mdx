# Azure SMS

## Profile Requirements

To deliver an SMS message through Azure SMS, Courier must be provided the recipient's SMS-compatible phone number. This value should be included in the recipient profile as `phone_number`.

```json title=JSON
// Recipient Profile
{
  "phone_number": "+12345678901"
}
```

## Overrides

Overrides can be used to change the request that Courier makes to the provider. Overrides are useful when a field is not yet supported by Courier or you would like to override the value that Courier generates. You can override the `authToken`, `from` and `email` as well as the `body` of the SMS content.

```json title=JSON
{
  "event": "<COURIER_NOTIFICATION_ID>",
  "recipient": "katherine_pryde",
  "profile": {
    "phone_number": "+12345678901"
  },
  "data": {
    "name": "Katherine Pryde"
  },
  "override": {
    "azure-sms": {
      "body": {
        "to": "+19876543210",
        "message": "I am the right content for the SMS"
      }
    },
    "config": {
      "from": "<override from number>",
      "accessKey": "<override access key>",
      "endpoint": "<override endpoint>"
    }
  }
}
```
