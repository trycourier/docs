# Building Automations Workflows

## The Invoke API

It is possible to quickly create and invoke an Automation Run using only the `/automation/invoke` API. With this approach the Automation definition is defined in the request body and is immediately executed at request time.'

Here is an Automation Run example to send a message to a new user one day after they create an account or profile.

```json
{
  "automation": {
    "steps": [
      {
        "action": "delay",
        "duration": "1 day"
      },
      {
        "action": "send",
        "recipient": "user_id",
        "template": "TIPS_AND_TRICKS"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

and we could use an http client to make the following API call:

```javascript
const axios = require("axios");

const data = JSON.stringify({
  automation: {
    steps: [
      {
        action: "delay",
        duration: "1 day",
      },
      {
        action: "send",
        recipient: "user_id",
        template: "TIPS_AND_TRICKS",
      },
    ],
  },
});

axios({
  method: "post",
  url: "https://api.courier.com/automations/invoke",
  headers: {
    Authorization: "Bearer token",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  data,
})
  .then(function (response) {
    console.log(JSON.stringify(response.data));
  })
  .catch(function (error) {
    console.log(error);
  });
```

For such simple use cases it is often convenient to define the Automation workflow directly in the API request body. However if your use case requires more logical steps, scheduling functionality or if you would just like Courier to save the Automation definition for future use, then consider using the [The Template Designer](#the-template-designer).

For more information on additional properties see the [Accessing Dynamic Data](#accessing-dynamic-data) section below or visit the [Automation Steps](steps) documentation section.

## The Template Designer

The Automation Template Designer is an ideal tool to define a series of [Automation Steps](steps) once and invoke them
with either an [Automation Trigger](triggers) or an API call.

Instead of managing the Automation code, we store the logic within Courier. This allows us to easily edit the Automation Run in the future while reducing our code.

We can turn the above call into a Automation Template, using the following procedure:

1. Navigate to `https://app.courier.com/designer/automations` and click `Create Template`.

<Image img={require("../assets/automations/create-template.png")} alt="" />

2. Name the template and alias `DELAYED_DELIVERY` and toggle the editor to "Code Mode"

<Image img={require("../assets/automations/code-mode.png")} alt="" />

3. Copy and paste the request body from the original request into the Automation editor and click Publish:

```json
{
  "steps": [
    {
      "action": "delay",
      "duration": "1 day"
    },
    {
      "action": "send",
      "recipient": "user_id",
      "template": "TIPS_AND_TRICKS"
    }
  ]
}
```

<Image img={require("../assets/automations/code-mode-editor-example.png")} alt="" />

4. Now we can invoke the Automation Template using the alias we provided in step 2.

```javascript
const axios = require("axios");

axios({
  method: "post",
  url: "https://api.courier.com/automations/DELAYED_DELIVERY/invoke",
  headers: {
    Authorization: "Bearer token",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
})
  .then(function (response) {
    console.log(JSON.stringify(response.data));
  })
  .catch(function (error) {
    console.log(error);
  });
```

As you can see this application code is a lot shorter. We can also update the Automation Template, without editing our code. Let's extend this example to wait an additional day and then fetch user usage data and send it to our new user.

<!-- TODO: (Refer to the [Notification Guide]() for information on how to create a new Notification.) -->

1. Toggle the editor back to "Visual Mode".

<Image img={require("../assets/automations/visual-mode.png")} alt="" />

2. Select "New Step", and then select "Delay"

<Image img={require("../assets/automations/visual-mode-new-step.png")} alt="" />
<Image img={require("../assets/automations/visual-mode-delay-step.png")} alt="" />

3. Edit the Delay form to wait for 1 Day.

<Image img={require("../assets/automations/visual-mode-delay-form.png")} alt="" />

4. Select "New Step" again, and then select "Fetch Data". Then update the Webhook textarea in Fetch Data form to the following:

```json
{
  "url": "https://myapp.com/users/usage",
  "method": "GET",
  "params": {
    "userId": {
      "$ref": "data.user_id"
    }
  }
}
```

<Image img={require("../assets/automations/visual-mode-fetch-data-form.png")} alt="" />

We will discuss the syntax `"$ref": "data.user_id"` in the [Accessing Dynamic Data](#accessing-dynamic-data) section.

5. Select "New Step" again, and then select "Send", and update the Send form.

<Image img={require("../assets/automations/visual-mode-send-form.png")} alt="" />

5. Publish the template.

If you want to invoke the Automation on a schedule or in response to an event see the [Triggers](triggers) section.

That's it! Now whenever a new user signs up to our application, we will execute the following workflow:

1. Wait 1 Day
2. Send a TIPS_AND_TRICKS message to incentive user activity.
3. Wait 1 Day
4. Fetch the latest usage report for our new user.
5. Send a USER_USAGE_REPORT message to incentive user engagement.

## Accessing Dynamic Data

As we have seen it is a common use case to [send dynamic data](#passing-dynamic-data) to your Automation Run.
After all, using the latest data to send a notification is often the most engaging.

There are a few ways to access dynamic data in an Automation Run.

### The Automation Run Cache

The Automation Run Cache is a JSON object that an Automation Step from the Automation Run writes values to. This allows Automation Steps to share data across the entire Automation Run. In other words, one Automation Step can update the cache, while another Automation Step, that gets executed later, can read from it. The cache is only valid for the length of the run, so only steps that belong to the Automation Run can access the Automation Cache.

#### Initializing the Automation Run Cache

To initialize the Automation Cache, you can invoke the Automation Run with any of the following properties:

- `brand`
  - type: string
  - description: A unique identifier that represents the brand that should be used for rendering the notification.
- `data`
  - type: object
  - description: An object that includes any data you want to pass to a message template or accessor type. The data will populate the corresponding template variables.
- `profile`
  - type: object
  - description: an object that includes any key-value pairs required by your chosen Integrations (see our Provider Documentation for the requirements for each Integration.) If profile information is included in the request and that information already exists in the profile for the recipientId, that information will be merged.
- `template`
  - type: string
  - description: A unique identifier that can be mapped to an individual Notification. This could be the "Notification ID” on Notification detail pages (see the Notifications page in the Courier app) or a custom string mapped to the event in settings.
- `recipient`
  - type: string
  - description: A unique identifier associated with the recipient of the delivered message, which can optionally map to a Courier managed profile. -->

Continuing with our example, let's initialize the Automation Cache with the `user_id` of our new user.
We will add the `user_id` to the `data` property of the Automation Run Cache, and include it in our https request body:

```javascript
const axios = require("axios");

const user = db.createUser();

axios({
  method: "post",
  url: "https://api.courier.com/automations/DELAYED_DELIVERY/invoke",
  headers: {
    Authorization: "Bearer token",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  data: {
    data: {
      user_id: user.id,
    },
  },
})
  .then(function (response) {
    console.log(JSON.stringify(response.data));
  })
  .catch(function (error) {
    console.log(error);
  });
```

#### Reading from the Automation Run Cache

To read values from the Automation Cache you can use an "accessor type":

```json
{
  "action": "send",
  "recipient": {
    "$ref": "data.user_id"
  }
}
```

An "accessor type" is simply an object with the key `$ref` and a string value that represents
a property path to the Automation Cache object.

Lets update the Send step to read from Automation Cache.

1. First switch the designer to "code mode", and update the `recipient` property value to:

```json
"recipient": {
  "$ref": "data.user_id"
}
```

and click Publish

<Image img={require("../assets/automations/code-mode-accessor-type.png")} alt="" />

Now if you switch the designer back to "Visual Mode", you will see the Send Form has also updated.

<Image img={require("../assets/automations/visual-mode-form-accessor-type.png")} alt="" />

The `Recipient ID` field of the Send Form has changed to `refs.data.user_id`. This is a "form accessor type", and is
analogous to the "accessor type" syntax described above, but is only valid in the Automation Step form editor.

#### Writing to the Automation Run Cache

There are two Automation Steps used to write data to the Automation Cache, Fetch Data and Send List.

We have already seen the Fetch Data Step earlier in this document. As a refresher, we simply provide a webhook url to the
Automation Step.

```json
{
  "action": "fetch-data",
  "webhook": {
    "url": "https://myapp.com/users/usage",
    "method": "GET",
    "params": {
      "userId": {
        "$ref": "data.user_id"
      }
    }
  },
  "merge_strategy": "replace"
}
```

When this step is executed, it will make an http request to `"https://myapp.com/users/usage"` and replace the Automation Cache's `data`
property with the response.

If you would like instead to merge the http response with the existing data in the Automation Cache you can provide a different
`merge_strategy`:

- `replace`
  - overwrite all properties in the Automation Cache with the http response. Remove's all in properties in the Automation Cache that do not exist in http response.
- `soft-merge`
  - only overwrite properties in the Automation Cache with the http response properties that do not yet exist in the Automation Cache.
- `overwrite`
  - overwrite all properties in the Automation Cache with the properties from the http response.
- `none`
  - do not make any changes to the Automation Cache if the Automation Cache already exists and has data. Otherwise initialize the Automation Cache.

The second step used to write data to the Automation Cache is the Send List step. For every recipient in the courier list, a the `webhook` property to the optional `data_source` object.
if called via `http`, and the run context is updated with the response.

```json
{
  "action": "send-list",
  "template": "USER_USAGE_REPORT",
  "list": "MY_COURIER_LIST",
  "data_source": {
    "webhook": {
      "url": "https://myapp.com/users/usage",
      "method": "GET",
      "headers": {}
    },
    "merge_strategy": "replace"
  }
}
```

When a Send List Automation Step is configured with the optional `data_source` property, the webhook url will be called with the `recipient_id` as a query param for each user in the list. It will then update the Automation Cache with the response and passed to the Notification Template and sent as a notification message.

For more information see Send List in the [Steps](steps) section.

#### Canceling the Automation Run

Let's extend our example again and imagine we want to cancel the DELAYED_DELIVERY Automation Run
if our new user deletes their account in our application. If this event occurs at any point during the Automation Run's execution,
then we want to cancel the Automation Run and not send any more messages.

1. First we need to make our Automation Run "cancelable" by providing a Cancelation Token value for our Automation Run. Let's name our token the same
   value as our users `user_id` by using the "accessor form type" `refs.data.user_id`

<Image img={require("../assets/automations/visual-mode-cancel-token.png")} alt="" />

2. Next, create Automation by selecting All Automations, then clicking Create Template. Give the Automation Template a name and alias of `CANCEL_NEW_USER_WORKFLOW`. Click Publish.

<Image img={require("../assets/automations/visual-mode-cancel-automation.png")} alt="" />

3. Click New Step and select a Cancel Automation from the menu. Set the value using the same "accessor form type" `refs.data.user_id`.

<Image img={require("../assets/automations/visual-mode-cancel-step-form.png")} alt="" />

4. Now let's update our application code to invoke the `CANCEL_NEW_USER_WORKFLOW` Automation when the user removes their account.

```javascript
const axios = require("axios");

const user = db.deleteUser(id);

axios({
  method: "post",
  url: "https://api.courier.com/automations/CANCEL_NEW_USER_WORKFLOW/invoke",
  headers: {
    Authorization: "Bearer token",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  data: {
    data: {
      user_id: user.id,
    },
  },
})
  .then(function (response) {
    console.log(JSON.stringify(response.data));
  })
  .catch(function (error) {
    console.log(error);
  });
```
