# Cancelling An Automation

Often times you may want to cancel an automation run. For example, one automation may send out
a reminder notification to complete a task. However, this reminder may no longer be necessary
if the task is already completed.

To allow an automation to be cancelled:

1. Navigate to the settings tab of the automation
2. Add a cancellation token. This can be any value desired. Its best to use a dynamic value so
   a specific automation invocation may be cancelled, rather than all running instances. For
   example, you may use `refs.data.userId`, which would allow the automation run to be associated
   with the user the automation would send to.
3. Publish

<video width="783" loop autoPlay muted controls a poster={videoThumbnail}>
  <source src={settingUpCancellationURL} />
</video>

4. Create a new automation
5. Add the `Cancel Automation` node
6. Set the token to the same token from step 2.
7. Publish

<video width="783" loop autoPlay muted controls poster={videoThumbnail}>
  <source src={segmentCancelNodeURL} />
</video>

An automation can also be canceled from automation logs. 

1. Navigate to the [automation logs page](https://app.courier.com/logs/automations) in Courier.  
2. Find your automation in the logs, you can search with a run Id or source.
3. If your automation has not finished processing, a cancel button will be shown in the run summary.
4. Clicking this button will cancel your automation.
