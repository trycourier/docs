# Triggers

An Automation Trigger is mechanism to invoke an Automation Run.
Currently only an Automation Run designed in the Automation Template Designer is eligible to be invoked via a Trigger.
There are currently three possible trigger sources that can be configured to invoke an Automation Run, a cron schedule, a Segment event and a Courier Audience event.

## The Cron Schedule Trigger

To invoke an Automation Run on a reoccurring schedule you can attach a Cron trigger to the Automation Run.

1. Select the Start block in the Automation Template Designer and select "Scheduled Trigger"

2. Enter a cron schedule expression to invoke the Automation Run. You can use https://crontab.guru/ to dial in your cron expression. In this example I will invoke the Automation Run every hour.

## The Segment Event Trigger

To invoke an Automation Run given a Segment Track event on group or identity you can attach a Segment Event trigger to the Automation Run.

1. Select the Start block in the Automation Template Designer, select Track under the _Add a Segment Event to Trigger this Automation_ section, and enter the event name. Optionally specify Identity or Group.

## The Audience Match Trigger

To invoke an Automation Run given a Courier Audience match or unmatched event you can attach an Audience Event trigger to the Run.

1. Select the Start block in the Automation Template Designer, select either "Match" or "Unmatched" under the _Audience Events to Trigger this Automation_ section.
