# Throttle

:::note

Status: This product is under active development and is available in a Private Beta, please
contact Courier support for access.

:::

The Throttle step in an automation limits the number of events that can pass into the next node within a specific period, dropping any additional events. This prevents customers from receiving too many messages about the same event.

## Example Use Cases

**Alert Notifications**

When sending alert notifications, you may want to limit the number of notifications sent to a user in a given period to avoid bombarding them with too many alerts.

**Email Campaigns**

If you are running an email campaign, you may want to limit the number of emails sent to a customer within a specific timeframe to avoid overwhelming them with too many messages.

In general, a Throttle step can be useful in any situation where you need to control the flow of data or limit the frequency of an action.

Courier will allow you to specify what next steps should be taken when the throttle is triggered, and what steps should be taken when the throttle is not triggered.

## Creating A Throttle Step

To create a Throttle, use the "Throttle" action, then fill out details in the step node.

Specify maximum number of events to allow through the throttle, and the time period to throttle by.

You have the options to throttle by:

| Scope     | Usage                                                                                                      |
| :-------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `user_id` | Apply throttling by using `user_id` coming from `data`                                                     |
| `GLOBAL`  | Let Courier decide the throttle parameter.                                                                 |
| `Dynamic` | You can use arbitary value available in your `run_context` by referencing it like `refs.data.throttle_key` |

**Note:** This is a beta feature, and we are working on adding more options for throttling.

Below is an example of a throttle step that will allow 2 event to pass through for a given user in a 24 hour period before throttling.

In this example, the throttle is set to be applied by `user_id`. You have to supply `user_id` in the following manner to throttle the user.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.courier.com/automations/<automation_template_id>/invoke \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <replace_with_api_key>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "data": {
		"user_id": "<user_id>"
  }
}
```
