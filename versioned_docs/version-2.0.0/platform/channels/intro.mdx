# Introduction

Courier allows you to design and send notifications across five different communication channels: Email, SMS, Push, Chat, and In App. For each channel, Courier integrates with many of the widely used providers.

Sending a notification requires a profile (`message.to`), which can be sent inline or retrieved using the `message.to.user_id`. [Channel Rules](../../reference/vocabulary.mdx#channel-rules) use this profile information to prioritize where with which Channel and Integration a notification is sent.

The "Profile Requirements" for each integration are available in the menu to the left organized by Channel.
