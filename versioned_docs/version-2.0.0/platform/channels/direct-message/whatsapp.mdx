# WhatsApp

Courier uses the [Twilio API for WhatsApp <FiExternalLink />](https://twilio.com/whatsapp) as our delivery partner. 

## Profile Requirements

To deliver a message to a recipient over Twilio Whatsapp, Courier must be provided the recipient's SMS-compatible telephone number. This value should be included in the recipient profile as `phone_number`.

```json title=JSON
{
  "message": {
    // Recipient Profile
    "to": {
      "phone_number": "555-555-5555"
    }
  }
}
```
