# Viber

## Viber Requirements

1. A Viber [bot account](https://partners.viber.com/account/create-bot-account). Make a note of the auth token.
2. An active webhooks server that can receive POST requests from Viber. Viber provides a [nodejs utility](https://www.npmjs.com/package/viber-bot)
 for handling these requests.
3. The recipient must have an active [Viber](https://www.viber.com/en/) account logged into either the iOS or Android app.

## Webhooks Server

Before sending notifications Viber requires a webhooks server to be registered. This can be done using the following cURL command:

```bash
 curl -X POST 'https://chatapi.viber.com/pa/set_webhook'\
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json'\
      -H 'X-Viber-Auth-Token: <VIBER_AUTH_TOKEN>'\
      -d '{ "url": "<YOUR_WEBHOOK_SERVER_URL>", "event_types": ["delivered"] }'
```

This webhooks server will receive [events](https://www.npmjs.com/package/viber-bot) from Viber such as UserID's of users who wish to subscribe, as well as notification delivery status events.

## Sending a Direct Message

To send a direct message to a user, supply the Viber `UserID` to the `viber.receiver` property of the recipient profile. This `UserID` is sent to the webhooks server after they send a message to the Viber bot.

```js
{
  "message": {
    // Recipient Profile
    "to": {
      "viber": {
        "receiver": "12943673=="
      }
    }
  }
}
```
