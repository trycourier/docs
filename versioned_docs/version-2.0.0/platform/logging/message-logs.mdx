## Using the Message Logs

The Courier Message Logs provide a timeline and insights into the status of your notifications, recipients, lists and automations. Each step in the Send status has a visual representation.

### Other Message Statuses

- **Canceled:** The message delivery was canceled.
- **Undeliverable:** The channel provider did not accept the send request from Courier.
- **Unmapped:** the Notification ID does not exist or the Event ID included in the send command is not mapped to a Notification.
- **Has Errors:** indicates that the timeline in the Send detail view includes an error response.
- **Throttled:** Notifications are being throttled either because there are [send limits](../sending/guardrails.mdx) in effect, or your workspace has reached its free quota.
- **Simulated:** Notifications are being sent with a [mock key](../content/notification-designer/environments-api-keys.mdx) and are simulating the message lifecycle without sending to the downstream provider.

### Send Detail View

When you click a Notification to open the Log Detail view you will see a Summary and Timeline.

- **Summary -** See details like the Message and Recipient IDs, as well as Date and time stamps for Send stages (Enqueued, Sent, First Delivery, Status, etc.).
- **Timeline -** Detailed timeline of every step in the timeline. The timeline can be scrolled and events in the timeline can be clicked to open additional details.

### Filtering your Message Logs

The message log includes a filter to search and narrow your notification logs by send `Status`, `Errors`, or to inspect the results of specific `Providers`, `Notifications`, or `Recipient`.

  alt="Error Tab"
/>

### Date, Recipient and Notification Filters

- The Log date filter allows you to filter to see notifications send on specific dates (see the [pricing page](https://www.courier.com/pricing/) for details on log retention timeframes).
- Filter by Email or Recipient ID
- Filter by a specific Notification or search them all.

  alt="Date Filter"
/>

### Notification Status Filter

You can filter your Notification Logs by selecting one or more Status types: Queued, Sent, Delivered, Opened, Clicked, Undeliverable or Unmapped.

:::info

Unmapped means that an Event was posted to our Send API with an `eventId` that does not [map to a notification](https://help.courier.com/en/articles/4189555-send-basics-how-notifications-are-triggered-and-sent-with-courier) or an invalid notification ID.

### Error Status Filter

You can also identify notifications with any status that also have errors.

### Provider Filter

You can review the logs of any combination of your integrated providers by selecting them in the `Provider` filter.

## Automation Logs

The [Automation](../automations/intro.mdx) logs provide detailed insights into the status of an automation run as well as step details.

### Automation Run List
