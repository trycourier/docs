## Using the Message Logs

The Courier Message Logs provide a timeline and insights into the status of your notifications, recipients, lists and automations.

### Your Notification Data at a Glance

The message logs convey a great deal of information in the summary view:

- The `Status` of each message send request
- The `Notification` and `Recipient` of associate with each `Send` status
- The `Provider` channels for the notification

### Send Status Key and Definitions

Each step in the Send status has a visual representation.

  alt="Status Keys"
/>

- **Queued:** Courier has received a properly formatted and valid Send API request and is attempting to Send the Notification.
- **Sent:** means that the channel provider sent the message to the recipient
- **Delivered:** certain channel providers allow us to confirm that the message was accepted (in the case of Email this means it hit their inbox).
- **Opened:** the message was delivered and opened by the recipient (only available for certain channel providers).
- **Canceled:** The message delivery was canceled.
- **Clicked:** user clicked a link in the notification. (This is only available for certain channel providers and only after you enable [click tracking in Courier settings](../workspaces/track-email-opens.mdx)).
- **Undeliverable:** The channel provider did not accept the send request from Courier.
- **Unmapped:** the Notification ID does not exist or the Event ID included in the send command is not mapped to a Notification.
- **Has Errors:** indicates that the timeline in theSend detail view includes an error response.

### Notification Log Detail View

To view the details of a Notification Send, click the Notification in the list view to open the Log details.

### Send Detail View

When you click a Notification to open the Log Detail view you will see a Summary and Timeline.

- **Summary -** See details like the Message and Recipient IDs, as well as Date and time stamps for Send stages (Enqueued, Sent, First Delivery, Status, etc.).
- **Timeline -** Detailed timeline of every step in the timeline. The timeline can be scrolled and events in the timeline can be clicked to open additional details.

### Timeline Event View

If you want to see the details of any event in the timeline, click it to open. As an example, you can click into the `Error Encountered` tab in the timeline to review the error message.

### Filtering your Message Logs

The message log includes a filter to search and narrow your notification logs by send `Status`, `Errors`, or to inspect the results of specific `Providers`, `Notifications`, or `Recipient`.

### Date, Recipient and Notification Filters

- The Log date filter allows you to filter to see notifications send on specific dates (see the [pricing page](https://www.courier.com/pricing/) for details on log retention timeframes).
- Filter by Email or Recipient ID
- Filter by a specific Notification or search them all.

### Notification Status Filter

You can filter your Notification Logs by selecting one or more Status types: Queued, Sent, Delivered, Opened, Clicked, Undeliverable or Unmapped.

:::info

Unmapped means that an Event was posted to our Send API with an `eventId` that does not [map to a notification](https://help.courier.com/en/articles/4189555-send-basics-how-notifications-are-triggered-and-sent-with-courier) or an invalid notification ID.
