# Analytics

:::info INFO
This feature is available to [Business-tier](https://www.courier.com/pricing/) customers.
:::

See stats for notifications (sent, delivered, opened, clicked, errors, etc.) with the ability to filter per channel with customized time windows and date ranges. We currently support template-level analytics that lets you gain insights on Send volume and Channel performances.

## Template Analytics (Notification metrics)

This feature gives granular statistical data points on a particular template. You can visually infer how a notification template is performing across multiple channels through a particular time range.

### Send volume

A chart visualization on how the notification send volume has evolved over time.

### Channel performance

A tabular representation of sends, delivered, opened, clicked and errors - for each channel and provider. This can help determine the ideal channel and/or provider for your notification template!

### Delivered Events

Some email providers like [SendGrid](../../external-integrations/email/sendgrid.mdx) offer granularity for their API keys, and will need [further customization](https://sendgrid.com/en-us/blog/introducing-api-key-permissions) so that `delivered` events can be sent to Courier.

:::info API Key Permissions

In order for Courier to receive `delivered` events from SendGrid, your [API key permissions](https://sendgrid.com/en-us/blog/introducing-api-key-permissions) need to include `email activity` and `inbound parse` so that `delivered` events can be counted in your message metrics.
