# Outbound Webhooks

Courier can use webhooks to notify your application when an event occurs in your account.

## Adding a New Webhook Destination

1. Visit [https://app.courier.com/settings/general](https://app.courier.com/settings/general)
2. Click the "+ Outbound Webhook" button
3. Enter the new webhook destination information (this should accept a `POST` request)

## Handling Requests from Courier

### Read the Event Data

Courier sends the event data in the request body. Each event is structured as an object with a `type` property and related resource data nested under the `data` property.

### Handle the Event

Courier currently supports the following event types:

- `message:updated`
- `notification:submitted`
- `notification:submission_canceled`
- `notification:published`
- `audiences:updated`
- `audiences:user:matched`
- `audiences:user:unmatched`
- `audiences:calculated`

Your webhook should be prepared to handle any of these events based on the `type` property in the received payload. Additional event types may be added in the future.

### Return a 200 Response

Send a successful 200 response to Courier as quickly as possible. Write any long-running processes as code that can run asynchronously outside the webhook endpoint.

## Verifying Signatures

Verify the events that Courier sends to your webhook endpoints. Courier can optionally sign the webhook events it sends to your endpoints by including a signature in each event's `courier-signature` header. This allows you to verify that the events were sent by Courier, not by a third party.

```
t=1631816343012,signature=33777cdae0468ff0939b3609d02d14e6e80ca093c2ea233455f0767055218875
```

Courier generates signatures using a hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) with SHA-256.

### Step 1: Extract the Timestamp and Signature from the Header

Split the header using the `,` character as the separator to get a list of elements. Then split each element using the `=` character as the separator to get a prefix and value pair.

The value for the prefix `t` corresponds to the timestamp, and `signature` corresponds to the signature.

Before you can verify signatures, you need to retrieve your endpoint's secret from your [Webhooks settings](https://app.courier.com/settings/webhooks) by clicking on a webhook configuration.

### Step 2: Prepare the `signed_payload` String

The `signed_payload` string is created by concatenating:

- The timestamp (as a string)
- The actual JSON payload (i.e., the request body)

### Step 3: Determine the Expected Signature

Compute an HMAC with the SHA256 hash function. Use the Courier webhook secret as the key and the payload string as the message.

```js title=TypeScript
const examplePayload = {
  data: {
    enqueued: 1631833955972,
    event: 'SNKDF4GZK94M0NHXBJQDF8GAQWM1',
    id: '1-6143cf63-4f27670f6304f465462695f2',
    providers: [],
    recipient: 'c156665c-a76c-4440-9676-f25c1b04ba93',
    recipientId: 'c156665c-a76c-4440-9676-f25c1b04ba93',
    status: 'ENQUEUED',
  },
  type: 'message:updated',
};

function parseHeader(header: string) {
  if (typeof header !== 'string') {
    return null;
  }

  return header.split(',').reduce((accum, item) => {
    const kv = item.split('=');

    if (kv[0] === 't') {
      accum.timestamp = kv[1];
    }
    if (kv[0] === 'signature') {
      accum.signature = kv[1];
    }

    return accum;
  }, { timestamp: -1, signature: '' });
}

// headers refers to the request headers from the incoming webhook event from Courier
const headerDetails = parseHeader(headers['courier-signature']);

const unfoldedSignature = crypto
  .createHmac('sha256', secret)
  .update(`${headerDetails.timestamp}.${JSON.stringify(examplePayload)}`, 'utf8')
  .digest('hex');

const isValid = unfoldedSignature === headerDetails.signature;
```

### Step 4: Compare the Signatures

Compare the signature (or signatures) in the header to the expected signature. For an equality match, compute the difference between the current timestamp and the received timestamp, then decide if the difference is within your tolerance.

To protect against timing attacks, use constant-time string comparison to compare the expected signature to each of the received signatures.

## Event Data

### message:updated

The `data` property in the webhook response payload for the `message:updated` event is identical to the information returned from the [GET /message/:message_id](../../reference/logs/by-id.mdx) endpoint.

For example, when an email is sent, it goes from `ENQUEUED` → `SENT` → `DELIVERED` → `OPENED`.

Here's a rundown of how the payloads would look for each event:

**Example Payload for an ENQUEUED Event**

```json title=JSON

For the notification template submission workflow, Courier emits `notification:submitted`, `notification:submission_canceled`, and `notification:published` events.

### notification:submitted

Example:

```json title=JSON
{
  "data": {
    "id": "<NOTIFICATION_ID>",
    "submission_id": 1620095270807 // submission ID is a timestamp of submission
  },
  "type": "notification:submitted"
}
```

### notification:submission_canceled

Example:

```json title=JSON
{
  "data": {
    "id": "<NOTIFICATION_ID>",
    "canceled_at": 1620095280807,
    "submission_id": 1620095270807
  },
  "type": "notification:submission_canceled"
}
```

### notification:published

Example

```json title=JSON
{
  "data": {
    "id": "<NOTIFICATION_ID>",
    "published_at": 1620095270807
  },
  "type": "notification:published"
}
```

### audiences:updated

This event is fired when your [audience](https://www.courier.com/docs/reference/audiences/put/) is created or updated.

Example:

```json title=JSON
{
  "data": {
    "audience_id": "software-engineers",
    "audience_version": 11,
    "filter": {
      "path": "title",
      "value": "Software Engineer",
      "operator": "EQ"
    }
  },
  "type": "audiences:updated"
}
```

### audiences:user:matched

This event is fired when a user is matched to an audience. This usually happens when a user is created or updated. If user's [profile](https://www.courier.com/docs/reference/profiles/replace/) matches any of the audience's filters, the user is matched to the audience.

Example:

```json title=JSON
{
  "data": {
    "audience_id": "software-engineers",
    "audience_version": 11,
    "reason": "EQ('title', 'Software Engineer') => true",
    "user_id": "suhas"
  },
  "type": "audiences:user:matched"
}
```

### audiences:user:unmatched

This event is fired when a user is unmatched to an audience. This usually happens when a user is [removed](https://www.courier.com/docs/reference/profiles/delete/) or updated in such a way that it no longer matches any of the audience's filters.

Example

```json title=JSON
{
  "data": {
    "audience_id": "favorite-fooss-players",
    "audience_version": 4,
    "reason": "EQ('favorite_game', 'fosss') => true, EQ('gender', 'pigeon') => true, EQ('style', 'defend') => true",
    "user_id": "suhas_with_foss"
  },
  "type": "audiences:user:unmatched"
}
```

### audiences:calculated

This event is fired when Courier is done calculating audiences. This is a background process that runs every time you create or update an audience. It can take varaible time depending on total number of users you have created in your Courier workspace.

Example

```json title=JSON
{
  "data": {
    "audience_id": "software-engineers",
    "user_count": 1,
    "total_users": 28,
    "total_users_filtered": 27
  },
  "type": "audiences:calculated"
}
```
