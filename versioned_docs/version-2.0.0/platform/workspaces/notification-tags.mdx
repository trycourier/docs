# Organizing and Filtering Notifications with Tags

> Adding tags to your Notifications helps you filter and search your Courier notifications.

When you have a long list of notifications, adding tags allows you to search and filter your list of Notifications by multiple, custom parameters in addition to Name and Channel. Tags are especially valuable because you can filter on more than one tag at a time, while the search field only allows you to search one term at a time.

## Create, Tag or Untag Using the Notification List View Modal

- Open the tag's dropdown menu on the far right of its list row.
- Type a new tag name into the Create Tag field and assign it a color.
- Once the tag is created, click on it to assign it to the Notification.
- To tag the Notification with an existing tag, simply click on the tag name.
