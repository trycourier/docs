# Okta Integration 

## Introduction

This guide will walk you through the steps necessary to allow your team to sign in to Courier with Okta.

## Prerequisites

- An Okta account with Admin privileges.
- Each user must be invited to courier via email before they can log in with Okta.
- Some of these steps require information to be received from _and_ sent to courier. Before continuing, contact Courier support and ask for assistance in setting up Okta Sign in.

## Create the App Integration in Okta

1. Navigate to the Applications > Applications section of the Okta admin panel
2. Hit the "Create App Integration Button":

| Name | Name Format | Value |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| `id` | Unspecified | user.id |
| `http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress` | Unspecified | user.email |

7. Hit the "Next" button towards the bottom of the page
8. Under the "Application Feedback" section, select "I'm an Okta customer adding an internal app" and hit "Finish":

9. From the "Sign On" tab of the new Courier application integration, find the Metadata URL. Copy the link address and send it to the Courier support team member

That's all thats needed to allow sign in with Okta. Be sure to assign users using the Assignments tab of Courier App Integration.

## Creating a Courier Bookmark App

Bookmark apps are used to direct users to a specific web page using Okta applications. Below is a step-by-step process to create a Courier bookmark app within the Okta Admin Panel.

:::info

Before you can create a bookmark, you will need a bookmark URL from Courier for IdP initiated SSO to work. Please [contact Support](mailto:support@courier.com) to get set up with the bookmark URL.

### Steps

1. Make sure you're logged-in to the Okta admin panel as an `Admin`.
2. Expand the `Applications` drop-down in the left pane, then click `Applications`.
3. Click `Browse App Catalog`.
4. Search for `Bookmark App`, select it from the list of results, and click `Add` in the left pane.
5. Choose an app name, in this example `Courier Login`, which will be the display name.
6. Copy the URL supplied by Courier Support directly to into the URL box:

7. Click `Save`.
