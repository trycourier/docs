# Handlebars Editor for Email Notifications

> It's possible to edit the HTML of a Courier Email notification directly using the Handlebars template override.

## Override the Notification Designer With Handlebars

If you want to edit the HTML / Handlebars code of an Email Notification directly, you can switch from the Notification Designer to the Handlebars editor.

<Image
  img={require("../../../assets/guides/courier-app/handlebars-toggle.png")}
  alt="Create Your Notification"
/>

This is a useful way to import existing HTML templates into Courier.

<Image
  img={require("../../../assets/guides/courier-app/handlebars-editor.png")}
  alt="Create Your Notification"
/>

:::caution Note

Content created using the Handlebars override is not reusable across channels.

:::

If you need to use Handlebars for a portion of your email, use [template blocks](../content-blocks/template-blocks.mdx) and combine them with other [block types](notification-designer-overview.mdx#reusable-drag-and-drop-content) to allow your non-handlebars code content to be re-used in other channels.

{/* Link follow-up doc */}

Edits made in the Handlebars editor will not apply to other Email notifications. To define the look and feel of all your emails at once, [customize your default brand template](../../brands/how-to-use-brands-to-customize/#customize-your-brands).
