### Add and Prioritize Channels

Add new channels to a Notification with a single click then drag them to reorder their [send priority](../../../platform/sending/channel-priority.mdx).

### Reusable, Drag and Drop Content

Every channel allows you to use drag and drop content blocks to place content without writing any code. Content you create in one channel is available in the Content Library for use in other channels.

- Consistent rendering across every email client.

- Reuse content in any channel.

The Designer allows one to [preview](how-to-preview-notification.mdx) branding, content with test variables, and Handlebars code in every channel.

- Create Test Events to validate your [JSON Paths](../variables/json-paths-variables.mdx) and [dynamic variables](../variables/inserting-variables.mdx). 
- Preview Emails in multiple brands.
- Send preview emails.
