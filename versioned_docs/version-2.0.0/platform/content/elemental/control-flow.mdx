# Control Flow

<TOCInline maxHeadingLevel={2} toc={toc} />

## Overview

In addition to their standard properties, Courier elements have a few additional properties that allow you to apply control flow logic to the element.

Each control flow property is optional.

## If

Allows an element to be conditionally rendered.

Applies to: `text`, `meta`, `channel`, `group`, `action`, `image`.

### Examples

Basic usage:

```json
{
  "type": "text",
  "content": "Hello, {{first_name}} {{last_name}}",
  "if": "data.some_field === 3"
}
```

## Ref

Allows an element to be named and referenced by other elements.

Elements that reference other elements have access to:

- The properties of that element
- A `visible` property which is set to `true` when the element is visible in the final render and `false` otherwise.

Note: An element cannot reference another before it is defined.

Applies to: `text`, `meta`, `channel`, `group`, `action`, `image`.

### Examples

Basic usage:

```json
{
  "type": "text",
  "content": "Hello, {{first_name}} {{last_name}}",
  "ref": "el3"
},
{
  "type": "text",
  "content": "Hello **world**",
  "if": "refs.el3.visible"
}
```

## Loop

Allows an element to be rendered multiple times based on an iterable data source.

The "loop" field must always evaluate to an iterable data source. The value of each
item in the iterable data source will be available to the `"content"` field as `$.item`.

To access the current index of the loop, use `$.index`.

The handlebars renderer of the content fields includes a number of math helpers that can be
used to assist rendering. These include:

- `add` (ex. `{{add 1 2}}`)
- `subtract` (ex. `{{subtract 1 2}}`)
- `divide` (ex. `{{divide 1 2}}`)
- `multiply` (ex. `{{multiply 1 2}}`)
- `abs` (ex. `{{abs -1}}`)
- `ceil` (ex. `{{ceil 1.1}}`)
- `mod` (ex. `{{mod 1 2}}`)
- `round` (ex. `{{round 1.1}}`)
- `floor` (ex. `{{floor 1.1}}`)

This is especially useful when using the `$.index` field. I.E. `Item no {{add $.index 1}}`.

Applies to: `text`, `channel`, `group`, `action`, `image`.

### Examples:

Basic usage:

```json
{
  "type": "text",
  "content": "* {{$.item.name}} listed at {{$.item.price}}",
  "loop": "data.products"
}
```

In the above example the full message payload would look something like this:

```json
{
  "message": {
    "content": {
      "version": "2022-01-01",
      "elements": [
        {
          "type": "text",
          "content": "* {{$.item.name}} listed at {{$.item.price}}",
          "loop": "data.products"
        }
      ]
    },
    "data": {
      "products": [
        {
          "name": "Mouse",
          "price": "$10"
        },
        {
          "name": "Keyboard",
          "price": "$20"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

In which case the text element would be expanded to this:

```json
{
  "type": "text",
  "content": "* Mouse listed at $10",
  "loop": "data.products"
},
{
  "type": "text",
  "content": "* Keyboard listed at $20",
  "loop": "data.products"
}
```

## Channels

Allows an element to be selectively rendered based on the current channel.

Channels is an array of valid channels to restrict the element to. Valid channels include `email`, `push`, `direct_message`, `sms` or a provider channel such as `slack`.

Applies to: `text`, `meta`, `channel`, `group`, `action`, `image`.

### Examples

```ts
{
  "type": "text",
  "content": "Hello, {{first_name}} {{last_name}}",
  "channels": ["email", "slack"]
}
```
