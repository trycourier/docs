# Asset Manager

The Asset Manager is a new way to organize assets in Courier. The Asset Manager can be used to organize your automation, message, and shared content templates.

## What is an asset?

Assets are defined as user generated content and can be uploaded or created through the ui.

:::info

ALL assets must be generated through the UI or API. Users cannot upload any form of content at this time.

## Asset View

You can switch between a list view and table view in the Asset Manager to help organize your notification content.

## Filtering

You can filter the Asset Manager to display your content based on the following criteria:

- Type: This can be a notification template, automation, or shared content
- Channels: Filter your assets by which channels are currently configured for your templates.
- Providers: Filter by the providers configured.
