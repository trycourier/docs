# Brand Snippets

## What are Brand Snippets?

Snippets are pieces of [handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) code that you can copy and paste or pull into a Template Block using the snippet name.

## Creating a Brand Snippet

To create a Snippet, navigate to the **Brands** tab in the Courier app and select the brand you want to add the Snippet to. Click the **Snippets** tab and then click the **Add Snippet** button.

## Using Brand Snippets in Templates

To use Snippets add a **Template Block** to an email Notification, and simply call it using a Template Block: `{{>snippet_name}}`

  alt="Brand Snippet Block"
/>

Using the Notification preview allows you to see the Snippet rendered:

/>

### Customizing Snippets with Variables

You can use variables to pull customized content into the Snippet, supplying the value for the variable inside the user profile sent via the Send API call.

### Brand Snippets and the Default Brand

If a snippet exists in the default brand, but not in a custom brand, the default brand snippet _will_ render in the custom brand as long as there isn't a snippet with the same name native to that custom brand.

This means you can put any or all of your snippets in the default brand and call them into multiple custom brands. Think of custom brands as extending the default. They can still have their own custom snippets as well.
