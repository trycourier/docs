# JSON Paths and Variables

> How to use JSON paths and Variables to insert data supplied in the Send API request or the User Profile into a notification.

The Notification Designer allows you to use external data in many places as you build your notification. This data, supplied by the data and profile objects of the [Send API](../../../reference/send/intro.mdx) request or the [Profiles API](../../../reference/profiles/intro.mdx), can be accessed using a Path.

Paths are used in the following:

- [Notification Conditions](../notification-settings/send-conditions.mdx) to disable notification sending.
- [Channel Conditions](../notification-settings/send-conditions.mdx/#for-notifications-and-channels) to disable channels within a Notification.
- [Filters](https://help.courier.com/en/articles/4193090-content-block-basics) to hide or show blocks.
- [Repeatable List Blocks](https://help.courier.com/en/articles/4209135-working-with-list-blocks) to set the list scope.
- [Substitution Variables](https://help.courier.com/en/articles/4260757-using-variables-to-insert-user-data-into-a-notification) to insert values into Notifications.  

## Path

A Path is a [JSONPath](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonpath) expression used to query the Courier Notification Context JavaScript object. This object contains notification related information, such as:

- `data`- An object passed to the send method
- `profile` - An object containing merged profile data passed to the send method and stored in Courier.

```json
{
  “data”: { … },
  “profile”: { ... }
}
```

You can build JSONPath expressions to access different data from this object. 

## Referencing Profile Information

If you want to access data from the profile object or data from the User Profile created with the [Profiles API](../../../reference/profiles/intro.mdx), use a full JSONPath expression such as `$.profile.someProp`. IE if you wanted to access the email, you could use the expression `$.profile.email`.

## Referencing Brand Information

If you want to access data from the active brand, use a full JSONPath expression such as `$.brand`. 

```typescript
{
  id: string;
  colors: {
    primary: string;
    secondary: string;
    tertiary: string;
  };
  inapp: {
    borderRadius: string;
    disableMessageIcon: boolean;
    placement: "top" | "bottom" | "left" | "right";
    emptyState: {
      textColor: string;
      text: string;
    };
    icons: {
      bell: string;
      message: string;
    };
  };
  email: {
    header: {
      barColor: string;
      logo: {
        href: string;
        image: string;
      };
    };
  };
  social: {
    facebook?: string;
    instagram?: string;
    linkedin?: string;
    medium?: string;
    twitter?: string;
  };
}
```

## Referencing Data Information

Because the majority of the data you'll want to access is in the `data` object, Courier has simplified that Path. Instead of providing a full JSONPath expression such as `$.data.someProp`, you can just use `someProp`. Courier will query `data` for any Path not prefixed with `$.` 

## Substitution Variables

Substitution Variables allow you to display the value of a Path. You can create one by wrapping the Path with curly braces. If you want to display the value of the name property passed in the data object, you can use `{name}`. 

You can include variables in your content blocks. At send time, Courier will replace the variable with the value located in the Path.

If we have the following text:

- `Ahoy {name}!`

and the following data:

```json
{
  “data”: {
    “name”: “Patrick”
  }
}
```

The result would be:

`Ahoy Patrick!`

If we need to access a value nested in the data object, we can do so using a JSONPath expression. If our data object looked like the following:

```json
{
  “data”: {
    “name”: {
      “first”: “Patrick”,
      “last”: “Star”
    }
  }
}
```

We would need to modify our variable path to our text to get the same result:

`Ahoy {name.first}!`

:::info Note

Because there is no way to create a fallback, if a value is not found, the variable path will be returned.
