# Markdown Blocks

Markdown Blocks allow you to create richly formatted content that can be rendered across multiple channels. 
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to write formatted content using plain text syntax. Courier uses Markdown Blocks to enable flexible content creation that can adapt to different delivery channels.
