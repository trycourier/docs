# List Blocks

List Blocks in Courier provide a powerful way to display complex, layered data across all notification channels. 
List Blocks allow you to dynamically render arrays of data in your notifications. They're available across all channels and come in four main types:

1. Simple list
2. List with children
3. List with images (email only)
4. List with children and images (email only)

To switch from bulleted lists to numbered lists, add a list then open the list details:

## Types of List Blocks

### Simple List

Displays a row for each item in the specified array, similar to a [text block](text-blocks.mdx) with variables scoped to the array.

### List With Children

Similar to a simple list, but includes child rows for nested array data.

### List With Images

:::info
Available for email channels only. Other channels display as list with children.
:::

Includes images alongside list items. Images can be linked and customized using variables.

### List With Children and Images

Combines features of lists with children and lists with images, allowing for complex, hierarchical data representation with visual elements.

## Configuring List Blocks

### Path

Set the JSONPath expression to point to the array you want to display. For example:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "trainers": [ "Ash", "Misty", "Brock"],
    "name": "Ash Ketchum",
    "region": "Kanto",
    "pokemon": [
      {
        "name": "Bulbasaur",
        "image": "https://example.com/001.png",
        "types": [
          { "name": "grass", "image": "https://example.com/grass.png" },
          { "name": "poison", "image": "https://example.com/poison.png" }
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "Ivysaur",
        "image": "https://example.com/002.png",
        "types": [
          { "name": "grass", "image": "https://example.com/grass.png" },
          { "name": "poison", "image": "https://example.com/poison.png" }
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "Venusaur",
        "image": "https://example.com/003.png",
        "types": [
          { "name": "grass", "image": "https://example.com/grass.png" },
          { "name": "poison", "image": "https://example.com/poison.png" }
        ]
      }
    ],
  }
}
```

To list all Pokemon, set the path to `pokemon`.

### Data References

- Inside path scope: Use `{propertyName}` to reference each item in the array
  - e.g. to display the name of the Pokemon, if the path is set to `pokemon`, you can use the variable `{name}`.
- Outside path scope: Use `{$.data.propertyName}` or `{propertyName}` if there isn't a property name conflict.
  - e.g. to display the top level `name` (Ash Ketchum), you can use the variable `{$.data.name}`.
  - e.g. to display the region, you can use the variable `{region}`.
- Array of strings: Use `{@}` to reference each item
  - e.g. to display each trainer in the `trainers` array, you can use the variable `{@}`.

### Styling

- Switch between bulleted and numbered lists in the list details
- Set background color for supported channels using the color picker
