# Jsonnet Blocks

**Availability:** [Slack](/platform/channels/direct-message/slack), [Microsoft Teams](/platform/channels/direct-message/microsoft-teams)

Jsonnet Blocks enable you to create dynamic, customized content for Slack and Microsoft Teams notifications using the Jsonnet templating language.

[Jsonnet](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/jsonnet/) is a JSON to JSON templating language, which means that combining Jsonnet with your user data allows you to build and send dynamic, custom Slack blocks and MS Teams Adaptive Cards in your notifications.

## Key Features

### Data Integration

- Access user data using the `data("variable")` syntax
- Dynamically populate message content based on user attributes or event data

### Templating

- Use Jsonnet's templating features to create reusable components
- Apply conditional logic to show or hide parts of your message

### Platform-Specific Elements

- Create Slack [Block Kit](https://api.slack.com/block-kit) elements
- Design Microsoft Teams [Adaptive Cards](https://adaptivecards.io/)

## Courier-Provided Templates

Courier offers several pre-built Jsonnet template blocks for common Block Kit actions:

- Buttons
- Dropdowns
- Images
- Text sections
- And more...

These templates can serve as starting points for your custom designs.

## Custom Block Kit Elements

You can also build your own [Block Kit](https://api.slack.com/block-kit) elements from scratch. The Jsonnet Block expects either a single Block Kit element or an array of elements.
