# Image Blocks

Image Blocks allow you to enhance your notifications with visual content across various channels. 
Image Blocks can improve the engagement and effectiveness of your notifications by providing visual context or appeal.

## Channel-Specific Behaviors

### Email

In email notifications, Image Blocks display as embedded images, allowing for rich visual content.

### SMS, Push

For SMS and push notifications:
- Image Blocks appear as URLs
- The rendering of these URLs depends on the integrated channel provider

### Direct Message

For supported direct message integrations:
- Images are displayed in real-time within the Courier editor
- No preview links are shown

## Advanced Usage

### Conditional Display

Like other content blocks, you can dynamically show or hide Image Blocks using [conditional filters](../notification-settings/send-conditions.mdx#for-content-blocks).

<Image
  img={require("../../../assets/guides/image-blocks/image-block-filter.png")}
  alt="Setting up an Image Block filter"
/>

## Best Practices

1. **Optimize for Mobile**: Ensure images are responsive and look good on various device sizes
2. **File Size**: Keep image file sizes small to improve loading times, especially for email
3. **Relevance**: Use images that are relevant to your message content
4. **Accessibility**: Always include descriptive alt text for screen readers
5. **Fallback**: Provide text alternatives for channels that may not support images
