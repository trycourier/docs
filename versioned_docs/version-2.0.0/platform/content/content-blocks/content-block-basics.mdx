# Content Block Overview

Content Blocks are the building blocks of your notifications in Courier. - Content Blocks are reusable, drag-and-drop components that allow you to build notification content across multiple channels. Key features include:

- Responsive and cross-channel by default
- Reusable across different notification channels
- Support for [variables](../variables/inserting-variables.mdx) and [conditional filtering](../notification-settings/send-conditions.mdx#for-content-blocks)

## Type of Content Blocks

- Text Blocks
- Image Blocks
- Action Blocks
- Divider Blocks
- Markdown Blocks
- Quote Blocks
- Template Blocks
- List Blocks
- Jsonnet Blocks

Some blocks, like Text and Action Blocks, have channel-specific options or formatting. For example, you can set the color of a text block differently for email and SMS.

## Working with Content Blocks

### Adding Content Blocks

1. Create a new notification and add delivery channels
2. Use the content toolbar to add desired block types
3. Drag and drop blocks to reorder them

### Using the Content Block Library

The Block Library stores shared channel content:

- Displays blocks not in use by the selected channel
- Marks unused blocks for easy identification
- Allows deletion of unused blocks

### Applying Conditional Filters

You can hide or show blocks based on specific conditions:

1. Select a block and click the filter button

/>

2. Set conditions in the modal that appears. You can use values passed in the data object or from the merged recipient profile for the property and values.

You can use values passed in the data object or from the merged recipient profile for the property and values. 
See [Content Block Conditions](../notification-settings/send-conditions.mdx#for-content-blocks) for more information.

### Customizing Block Settings

Each content block has block-specific settings. The available settings are block-dependent but include things like alignment, color, and text formatting.

### Removing a Block

Blocks can be removed from a channel by selecting the block and clicking the Remove Block button. This action will send it to the Block Library.
