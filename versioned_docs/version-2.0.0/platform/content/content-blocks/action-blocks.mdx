# Action Blocks

> A detailed look at Courier Action Block functionality, use cases and best practices.

## Working With Action Blocks

**Availability:** All channels

The action block presents the recipient with an action to perform. Depending on the channel, this could appear as a button or a link.

## Block Level Options

When you select an action block, you are presented with a toolbar with the following formatting options depending on the notification channel.

<GifWrapper width={920} height={614} caption="Action Block Options">

</GifWrapper>

### Edit

- Presents you with a modal to set the `Friendly Text` and `Action`. For most channels, the action is a URL. For Slack, you can opt to use a webhook.

### Button

- Displays the action as a button. If you drag a button from the reusable content library into a channel where the button is not an option, Courier automatically reformats it into a link.

:::info Note

Action buttons are not available across all channels. For SMS and Chat options, the button will render as a URL.

### Text

- Displays the action as a URL link.

### Align

- Allows you to align the content of the block left, center or right.

### Color

- Presents the users with a color picker to select the button color. You can use a color from the palette or enter the hex value for a custom color - or select from pre-defined brand template colors. This option is only available for action buttons.

## Hide an Action Block Using Conditions

It is possible to hide an action block - or any other type of block - using [conditional filters](../notification-settings/send-conditions.mdx/#for-content-blocks).
