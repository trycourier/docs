# Quote Blocks

Quote Blocks allow you to highlight important text or citations across different notification channels. 
Quote Blocks are designed to make specific text stand out from the rest of your notification content. They're particularly useful for emphasizing key points, displaying testimonials, or citing sources.


## Working with Quote Blocks

### Adding a Quote Block

1. In the Courier designer, click the "+" icon to add a new block
2. Select "Quote" from the block options
3. Enter the text you want to appear in the quote

### Cross-Channel Behaviors

Quote Blocks adapt their appearance based on the delivery channel:

#### Email

Creates an indented quote block with distinctive styling.

alt="Quote Block appearance in email"
/>

#### Slack

Text is indented and italicized to match Slack's quote formatting.

/>

#### SMS / Direct Message

Automatically wraps the text in quotation marks.

## Conditional Rendering

Like with any content block, Quote Blocks can be hidden using a [conditions filter](../notification-settings/send-conditions.mdx#for-content-blocks).
