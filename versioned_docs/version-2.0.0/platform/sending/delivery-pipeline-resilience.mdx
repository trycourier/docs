# Delivery Pipeline Resilience

Courier employs a robust retry mechanism to ensure reliable notification/webhook delivery and accurate status tracking, even in the event of temporary downstream failures or network issues.

## Notification Send Retries

### Retry Conditions

Courier will attempt to resend a notification under the following circumstances:

- No response from the integration (e.g., network connection lost)
- Integration response indicates a temporary issue (e.g., server overload, rate limit exceeded)
- Uncaught exception in Courier's pipeline

### Retry Strategy

Our retry strategy employs an exponential backoff approach:

1. Immediate retry for the first 10 attempts
2. 1-hour delay before the 11th attempt
3. 2-hour delay before the 12th attempt
4. 3-hour delay for attempts 13 through 25

This strategy spans 72 hours (3 days), maximizing the chances of successful delivery.

## Delivery Status Check Retries

### Retry Conditions

Courier will retry delivery status checks under these conditions:

- No response from the integration (e.g., network connection lost)
- Integration response indicates a temporary issue (e.g., server overload)
- Temporary failure in resolving the delivery status
- Uncaught exception in Courier's pipeline

### Retry Strategy

We employ the same exponential backoff strategy for status checks:

1. Immediate retry for the first 10 attempts
2. 1-hour delay before the 11th attempt
3. 2-hour delay before the 12th attempt
4. 3-hour delay for attempts 13 through 25

This approach ensures thorough tracking of delivery statuses over a 72-hour period.

## Outbound Webhook Delivery Retries

### Retry Conditions

Courier will attempt to retry outbound webhook delivery under the following circumstances:

- Internal Courier errors occur
- Network errors are encountered
- Certain retryable HTTP errors are received

### Retry Strategy

Our outbound webhook retry strategy employs an exponential backoff approach:

1. Initial retries with increasing delays: 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 120, 240, 480, 720, 900 seconds
2. After the 10th retry, a consistent 15-minute delay is used for subsequent attempts
3. Up to 296 retry attempts are made, spanning a maximum of 3 days
