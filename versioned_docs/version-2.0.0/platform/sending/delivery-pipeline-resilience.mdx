# Delivery Pipeline Resilience

> When and how Courier will retry a notification send and how it handles delivery status check retries.

## Send Retries

### Retry Requirements

> The following reasons will trigger a retry when trying to send a notification through an integration:

- The integration did not respond (e.g. network connection lost).
- The integration responded to our attempt with a reason to allow for a retry (e.g. server overloaded, rate limit exceeded etc.).
- Uncaught exception in our pipeline.

### Retry Attempts

> If we encounter any of the reasons above, we will retry immediately for the first ten attempts. Afterwards:

- We wait **one hour** before the 11th attempt
- We wait **two hours** before the 12th attempt
- We wait **three hours** before the 13th attempt up to the 25th attempt

The 25 attempts span over 72 hours giving us a chance to resolve the send within three days.

## Delivery Status Check Retries

### Status Check Requirements

> The following reasons will trigger a retry when trying to check the delivery status of a notification for some integrations:

- The integration did not respond (e.g. network connection lost).
- The integration responded at our attempted with a reason to allow for a retry (e.g. server overloaded).
- The integration had a temporary failure attempting to resolve the delivery status.
- Uncaught exception in our pipeline.

> If we encounter any of the reasons above, we will retry immediately for the first ten attempts. Afterwards:

- We wait **an hour** before the 11th attempt.
- We wait **two hours** before the 12th attempt.
- We wait **three hours** before the 13th attempt up to the 25th attempt.

The 25 attempts span over 72 hours giving us a chance to resolve the delivery status within three days.
