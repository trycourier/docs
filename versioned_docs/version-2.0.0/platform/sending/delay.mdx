# Delay

As part of a Send in Courier, you can define the time to wait before delivering the message and Courier will handle. Courier supports one of three ways to delay

1. delay by X milliseconds (`delay.duration`)
2. specify the ISO 8601 timestamp string (`delay.until`)
3. specify a Deliver Window using a partial implementation of [opening_hours](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:opening_hours) (`delay.until`). This also supports timezone offsets from within a user profile `timezone` key or `message.to.timezone`.


## Logging
When a delay is accepted via the API, you can verify it by viewing the Message Log for the request. You should see a `Request Delayed` event that specifies the time in GMT that the send take place.

**Example:**

```json
{
  "delay": {
    "duration": 120000
  },
  "details": {
    "duration": "Message delivery has been delayed by 2 minutes.",
    "date": "The message will be delivered on October 09, 2024 at 8:36 GMT+00:00"
  }
}
```



## Duration
Specifying a `delay.duration` will delay the send by this number of milliseconds. For example, this payload will send to the inbox only have 2 minutes.

```json
{
  "message": {
      "to": {"user_id": "test"},
      "delay": {"duration": 120000},
      "content": {"title": "Wait!", "body": "for 2 minutes"},
      "routing": {"method": "single", "channels": ["inbox"]
    }
}
```

:::info Duration is rounded up to next minute
When using `delay.duration`, we will round up to the next minute

## Timestamp
You can specify an [ISO8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) timestamp string in `delay.until`. Courier will calculate the delay and send the message at this time for you.

```json
{
  "message": {
    "to": {"user_id": "test-date-midnight"},
    "delay": {"until": "2025-01-01"},
    "template": "az09"
  }
}

{
  "message": {
    "to": {"user_id": "test-withtimezone"},
    "delay": {"until": "2024-10-11T06:37:25+7:00"},
    "template": "az09"
  }
}

{
  "message": {
    "to": {"user_id": "test-atutc"},
    "delay": {"until": "2024-10-11T06:37:25Z"},
    "template": "az09"
  }
}
```


## Delivery Window
You can specify a Delivery Window using a partial implementation of [opening_hours](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:opening_hours) (`delay.until`). This also supports timezone offsets from within a user profile or the message `to`. Based on the current time and the opening_hours string, Courier will calculate if it can send right now (is open) or delay until the next window.

- By default, Delivery Window will calculate the timezone in UTC, however it can be overridden by the `zoneinfo` or `timezone` key stored in the user profile or provided in the request (`message.to.zoneinfo` or `message.to.timezone`). Timezone can follow either [IANA timezones](https://www.iana.org/time-zones) or UTC+- syntax (UTC+4, UTC-5). 
- Opening hours calcuation is inclusive at the start of the range, and exclusive at the end of the range. For example, sending at Mo 08:00 exactly with Delivery Window `Mo-Fr 08:00-12:00` will **not** delay. Sending at Mo 12:00 exactly with Delivery Window `Mo-Fr 08:00-12:00` will delay until Tu 08:00
- Integrations like Segment.identify() will populate timezone [automatically](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/common/). It's common practice to leave that timezone key and use `zoneinfo` if you ask the user their preferred timezone and pass that in the identify call. E.g., `analytics.identify('user123', {zoneinfo: "Americas/Los_Angeles"})` will populate both the user's browser timezone and the selected timezone and store it in courier under `zoneinfo`
- If zoneinfo and timezone are both available, zoneinfo will take precedence.


**Examples:**
- Business Hours **(Mo-Fr 09:00-17:00)**
- Weekend **(Fr-Mo 17:00-09:00)**
- Only Mornings **(Su-Sa 08:00-12:00)**
- Single Day **(Mo 09:00-12:00, 14:00-18:00)**
- Same Day Different Entries **(Mo 09:00-12:00; Mo 14:00-18:00)**
- Non-Consecutive Entries **(Mo 09:00-12:00; We 14:00-18:00)**
- Only at 11am **(Su-Mo 11:00-11:00)**
- Next Halloween at 9am* **Oct 31 09:00-0900**

### Examples
```json
// /send Thursday at noon, will send 
// /send Saturday at noon, will delay until 8am the following Monday
{
  "message": {
    "to": {
      "user_id":  "test123",
      "timezone": "Americas/Los_Angeles"
    },
    "delay": { 
      "until": "Mo-Fr 08:00-16:30"
    }
  }
}

// If different profiles have different timezones, the calculation will also happen independantly. 
// /send at Friday at 23:00 UTC, America/Los_Angeles is open and will send now, 
// Americas/New_York is closed and will delay until Monday
{
  "message": {
    "to": [
      {
        "user_id":  "test123",
        "timezone": "Americas/Los_Angeles"
      },
      {
        "user_id":  "test456",
        "timezone": "Americas/New_York"
      }
    ],
    "delay": { 
      "until": "Mo-Fr 08:00-16:30"
    }
  }
}
```
