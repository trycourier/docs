# Hosted Page

> The hosted Preference Center is an external page that recipients are redirected to where they can customize and set their preferred notification delivery methods.

<Image
  img={require("../../../assets/guides/preferences-ui/preferences-hosted-page-example.png")}
  alt="Recipient Preference Center"
/>

A recipient can select to opt-in or out of a notification (depending on the subscription topic default state)
as well as select the preferred delivery channel for a notification (business-tier feature) from this page.

## Preference Center Link

When using a notification template, users can attach a Courier Preference Center hyperlink that will provide an auto-generated link. This link will open the hosted Preference Center; the recipient will be able to establish their notifications preferences at this page.

:::info User Id

In order for a recipient to successfully set their preferences from a notification, you must include `to.user_id` in the [Send request](/reference/send/message). This is because the `user_id` ties the recipient profile to their set preferences. If no `user_id` is present in the request, the preferences method will not register. For send v1, the `user_id` can be mapped to the `recipient` parameter.

### Adding Preferences Link To Notification Text

Add text to the notification template, highlight it, and select the create link icon.
