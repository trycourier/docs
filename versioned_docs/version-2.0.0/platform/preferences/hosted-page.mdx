# Preference Center

> The Preference Center is a Courier-hosted page that recipients are redirected to where they can customize and set their preferred notification delivery methods.

<Image
  img={require("../../assets/guides/preferences-ui/preferences-hosted-page.png")}
  alt="Preference Center"
/>

A recipient can select to opt-in or out of a notification (depending on the subscription topic default state)
as well as select the preferred delivery channel for a notification (business-tier feature) from this page.

## Preference Center Link

When designing a notification template, users can insert a variable link `{$.urls.preferences}` to the Courier Preference Center that will provide an auto-generated url. 
This link will open the hosted Preference Center where the recipient can configure their notifications preferences.

:::info User Id

In order for a recipient to successfully set their preferences from a notification, you must include `to.user_id` in the [Send request](/reference/send/message). 
This is because the `user_id` maps the recipient profile to their set preferences. If no `user_id` is present in the request, the preferences method will not register. 

:::

### Adding Preferences Link To Notification Text

Link to the Preference Center from within a notification body by creating a link, and specify `{$.urls.preferences}` as the URL.

  alt="Preferences URL"
/>

:::info Notification Preview

Sending a preview email from the notification template will **attach a mock URL** instead of the preference hosted page.

:::

### Adding Preferences Link To Brand Footer

The Preference Center link variable `{$.urls.preferences}` can also be added to directly to the brand footer.

  alt="Brand Template With Preferences Hyperlink"
/>

### Unsubscribe Link

In addition to the Preferences Center, an unsubscribe link can be added to unsubscribe recipients from the entire subscription topic. Use `{$.urls.unsubscribe}` to add an auto-generated unsubscribe link to your notification.

<Image
  img={require("../../assets/guides/preferences-ui/preferences-unsubscribe.png")}
  alt="Unsubscribe Hyperlink"
/>

The unsubscribe link will redirect a recipient to a Preferences page confirmation that they have been unsubscribed from the **entire notification and topic**.

:::info Single Subscription Topic

The unsubscribe link will opt a user out of the entire notification including any channels associated to it and redirect them to a _successfully unsubscribed_ confirmation page. The page will only display the subscription topic associated to that notification.

## Preference Center Branding

Just like with email templates, the Preference Center can be customized with your [brand](../content/brands/brands-in-email-notifications.mdx#customize-your-brands). 
The Preference Center will use the the logo and colors from your [default brand](https://app.courier.com/database/brands).

## Preview the Preference Center

To preview the Hosted Preference Page, navigate to the [Preference Editor](preferences-editor.mdx) and click on `Preview Page`.

## Delivery Channel Customization

If a notification template has multiple delivery channels configured, a recipient will be able to customize and set their preferred delivery channel from the Preferences Page.

:::info Business Tier Feature

Delivery Channel customization is a Courier Business feature. Please [contact](https://www.courier.com/request-demo/) our Product Experts for more details.

:::

Delivery channel customization allows recipients to choose their preferred delivery channel from the hosted preferences page. Recipient's custom delivery channels can be reflected as a `custom_routing` array in the response when calling the [Preferences API](../../reference/user-preferences/get-subscription-topic-preferences.mdx).

```json
{
	"topic": {
		"custom_routing": [
			"email"
		],
		"has_custom_routing": true,
		"default_status": "OPTED_IN",
		"section_id": "_ysuowndfnousd",
		"section_name": "Notifications",
		"status": "OPTED_IN",
		"topic_id": "TOPIC_ID",
		"topic_name": "Tips and Tricks"
	}
}
```

:::warning Channel Conditions

Channel [disable/enable conditions](../content/notification-settings/send-conditions.mdx) in a notification template **will not** take precedence when a user has `custom_routing` channels in their preferences topic. A channel can be disabled by using [missing variable guardrails](../content/variables/variable-not-found.mdx).
