## Subscription Topics

**Subscription Topics** are categories of notifications that users can opt-in and out of. 
For example, welcome and onboarding notifications could be mapped to an `Onboarding` topic.

:::info 

A notification template can only be mapped to a single subscription topic. 

:::

### Configuration

You can set topic properties like **Name**, the **Section** it will be in, and its **Default State**.

<Image
  img={require("../../assets/guides/preferences-ui/preferences-topic-settings.png")}
  alt="Subscription Topic Settings"
/>

### Default State

The **Default State** defines whether a topic can be opted in or out, and whether it's always required.

- `On` - Users who do not take any action will automatically receive notifications in this grouping.
- `Off` - Users will not receive these notifications unless they change their preferences.
- `Required` - Users will not be able to opt-out of these notifications.

## Preference Sections

**Preference Sections** group subscription topics together and determine which topic delivery channels users can opt in/out of.

###  Delivery Channel Selection

:::info Business Tier

Channel Selection is a Courier Business feature. [Contact sales](https://courier.na.chilipiper.com/book/me/sahil-cochinwala) for more details.

:::

**Delivery Channel Selection** gives recipients the ability to select and set the preference for their preferred delivery channel from the Preferences Hosted page.

Channel selection must be enabled for the subscription topic in order for users to customize their delivery channel preferences.

### Channel Delivery Customization & Preferences API

The `custom_routing` array in the [user preferences API](../../reference/user-preferences/get-subscription-topic-preferences.mdx) response indicates the user's custom channel delivery. Channel Delivery Customization **must be enabled** to use `custom_routing`.
:::

```json
{
	"topic": {
		"custom_routing": [
			"email",
			"push",
			"webhook"
		],
		"has_custom_routing": true,
		"default_status": "OPTED_IN",
