# Cancelling An Automation

Often times you may want to cancel an automation run. For example, one automation may send out
a reminder notification to complete a task. However, this reminder may no longer be necessary
if the task is already completed.

## Automation Settings

To allow an automation to be cancelled:

1. Navigate to the settings tab of the automation
2. Add a cancellation token. This can be any value desired. Its best to use a dynamic value so
   a specific automation invocation may be cancelled, rather than all running instances. For
   example, you may use `refs.data.userId`, which would allow the automation run to be associated
   with the user the automation would send to.
3. Publish

<Image img={require("./assets/cancelation.gif")} alt="Cancel Automation" />

4. Create a new automation
5. Add the `Cancel Automation` node
6. Set the token to the same token from step 2.
7. Publish

<Image img={require("./assets/checkout-complete.gif")} alt="Checkout Complete Automation" />

An automation can also be canceled from automation logs.

1. Navigate to the [automation logs page](https://app.courier.com/logs/automations) in Courier.
2. Find your automation in the logs, you can search with a run Id or source.
3. If your automation has not finished processing, a cancel button will be shown in the run summary.
4. Clicking this button will cancel your automation.

## Templated Cancelation Token

It may be advantageous to create a compound key for your cancellation token. For example, if you want to have a cancelation token that combines two different fields, or a data field and a static string. In automations, most fields support Javascript string interpolation and the cancelation token is an example of one. The documentation above says you can use `refs`, for example `refs.data.userId` and the following would be identical in the cancelation token field, `${data.userId}`. For more advanced interpolation you can perform nested interpolations as well.

**Static Fields**

```javascript
${`onboarding-flow-${data.userId}`}
```

**Combining Fields**

```javascript
${`${data.userId}-${data.tenantId}`}
```
