# GET Profile

The GET Profile node will attach the profile of the provided user id to the
automation context. This allows you to use the profile data in subsequent nodes.

By default the profile will be attached to the profile key in the run context
and can be accessed with `refs.profile`.

Generally, the user id should be set to a dynamic value from the data object
such as `refs.data.user_id`.

<video width="783" loop autoPlay muted controls poster={videoThumbnail}>

</video>
