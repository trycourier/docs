# Sending a Courier Inbox Message

When you're ready to [send a message](https://www.courier.com/docs/reference/send/message/), it's exactly like sending any other Courier notification, with the difference being that you are sending it to the `inbox` channel.

```json
{
	"message": {
		"to": {
			"user_id": <USER_ID>
		},
		"content": {
			"title": "How does {{ villain }} like his toast?",
			"body": "On the dark side."
		},
		"data": {
			"villain": "Darth Vader"
		}
		"routing": {
			"method": "single",
			"channels": ["inbox"]
		}
	}
}
```

## Passing Data for an Inbox Request

If you provide information in the `data` field, it will be passed automatically through to the SDK.

:::tip

If you pass information in `data` that isn't referenced in your `content` payload or in a `template` that you specify, it will still be passed through to your app. For example, this is useful when trying to launch a specific screen in your app on mobile with a deep link:

:::

`data.deeplinkUrl = https://starwars.com/villains/darth_maul`

## Using Courier Elemental Syntax

Inbox SDKs support a subset of [Elemental](../content/elemental/intro.mdx) syntax for composing inline messages.
