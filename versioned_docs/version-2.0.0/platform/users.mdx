# Users

Courier uses the term `user` to describe the recipient of a notification. You'll sometimes see the term `recipient` used, but these mean the same thing. There are several different ways to define which users will recieve a notification.

The code samples below illustrate a subset of the `message` object used to make a call to the [send API](../../reference/send).

## Inline

The simplest way to send a notification is to specify either an `email` or a `phone_number`.

```json
"to": {
    "email": "luke@skywalker.com"
}
```

## Profiles

Courier supports storing user contact information in a [Profile](../../reference/profiles) record, and then referencing a `user_id` when calling `send`. One of the benefits of this approach is that the specific channel that is used to deliver the notification can be deferred to a later step where routing rules are applied.

```json
"to": {
    "user_id": "luke1234"
}
```

## Lists

If you want to send a notification to more than one user, you can add as many users as you like to a [List](../../reference/lists) and then pass the `list_id`.

```json
"to": {
    "list_id": "rebel-alliance"
}
```

## Audiences

Instead of using a static list of users, you can create an [Audience](/reference/audiences) that will dynamically include users based on their attributes and a set of custom filtering rules that you define.

```json
"to": {
    "audience_id": "currently-on-hoth"
}
```

## Tenants

Courier support multi-tenant applications with the [Tenants](/reference/tenants) API. A single user can be associated with multiple tenants, and you can specify an `tenant_id` when sending a message in order to...

```json
"to": {
    "user_id": "luke1234",
    "tenant_id" : "red-squadron"
}
```

## Tokens

When sending push notifications to mobile devices, developers need to [create tokens](/reference/token-management) that are mapped to the users they are sending notifications to.

Once you create a token and attach it to a user and provider, you do not need to include it in the call to the [Send API](/reference/send) when you send a push notification.

```json
"message": {
    "to": {
        "user_id": "luke1234",
    },
    "content": {
        "title": "Where do Sith go shopping?",
        "body": "At the Darth Maul!"
    },
    "routing": {
        "method": "single",
        "channels": [
            "push"
        ]
    }
}
```

Additionally, if you use use the Courier [client SDK libraries](/sdk-libraries/) in your mobile application, they will automatically handle token generation and rotation for you automatically, so you won't need to handle [token management](/reference/token-management) in your code.
