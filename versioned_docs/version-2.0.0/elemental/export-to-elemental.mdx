# Export to Elemental

> [Courier Elemental](intro.mdx) offers a powerful JSON based syntax to send notifications in lieu of using notification templates.

Courier's Designer Studio offers DnD functionalities to build notification templates where users can invoke a notification by just referencing the template ID.

Courier now offers interoperability between notification templates and Elemental, so users can now get the best of both worlds.

With the `Export to Elemental` feature, users can use the designer to build notification templates and export them as Elemental syntax whether it's for sending raw code templates, or for establishing a template review process.

## Exporting Elemental Assets

Select the dropdown option on top-right of notification `Publish` button, and click `Export to Elemental`.

Copy the JSON output to use the Elemental syntax inside your `/send` request's payload.

Once copied, the Elemental syntax can be passed inside a `content` object of your send request.
