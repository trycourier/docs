# Locales

Locales allow you to customize elements based on the the locale of the target recipient.

At the moment locales is restricted to elements that have a `content` property. This includes `action`, `quote`, and `text` elements.

Locales take the following interface:

```typescript
interface Locales {
  [locale: string]: {
    content: string;
  };
}
```

When a `"locale"` is specified in the `message.to` field, each element that has content
for that `"locale"` will have their top level content property replaced by the locale specific
content.

```json
{
  "message": {
    "to": {
      "email": "person@example.com",
      "locale": "eu-fr"
    },
    "content": {
      "version": "2022-01-01",
      "elements": [
        {
          "type": "text",
          "content": "Hello",
          "locales": {
            "eu-fr": {
              "content": "Bonjour"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

In the above example, the text `"content"` would be replaced with `Bonjour`.
