# Using Send Conditions

> How to set conditional send rules to disable Notifications or Channels using properties from the Send API data object or User Profile.

Using the `Conditions` functionality in the Notification and Channel settings allows you to use properties from the data or profile objects provided by the [Send API](../../reference/send/intro.mdx) call or [User Profile](../../reference/profiles/intro.mdx) to prevent the notification from sending when specific conditions are met.

If you want to disable the *entire* notification, set your conditions in the [Notification Settings](general-settings.mdx). To disable specific Channels within the Notification, set your condition in the [Channel settings](../../sending-notifications/channel-settings.mdx).

:::info Note

- Channel conditions only apply to the channel where you set them.
- You cannot disable specific integrations within the channel. If you want to be able to disable specific integrations based on Conditions, add set the integration(s) as a stand-alone channel(s) in the notification. 

:::

## Setting Send Conditions

### For Notifications and Channels 

Open the Notification / Block Settings and select the Conditions tab.

If you set multiple conditions, **all** conditions must be met to disable the message.
