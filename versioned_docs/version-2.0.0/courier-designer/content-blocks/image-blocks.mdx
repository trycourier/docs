> A detailed look at Image Block functionality, use cases and best practices.

## Cross-Channel Behaviors

### SMS, Push

- When you add a new image block or pull one in from the library in SMS, push or DM, you will see the image URL. 
- How that URL is unfurled will depend on the integrated channel provider.  

### Direct Message

- If you have one of these direct message integrations as a channel, you will see the image block display your image in real-time in the editor, no preview links.

## Hiding Image Blocks Using Conditions

It is possible to hide an image block (or any other type of block) using [conditional filters](../notification-settings/send-conditions.mdx/#for-content-blocks).
