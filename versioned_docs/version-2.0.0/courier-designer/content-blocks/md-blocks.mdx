Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid HTML. Here's a complete list of [markdown syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) we use in our Markdown Blocks.

## Markdown Use Cases

**Pass user data into a Notification:** As an example, let's say your product allows users to add comments to an article and user comments can have formatting. 

- The Markdown block lets you pass that data to Courier (as a variable) and insert it into the markdown.
- This allows Courier to render that comment across any channel.
- If that comment was sent as HTML instead of Markdown, it could only be rendered in Email.

## Hide a Markdown Block Using Conditions

It is possible to hide a Markdown Block - or any other type of block - using [conditional filters](../notification-settings/send-conditions.mdx/#for-content-blocks).
