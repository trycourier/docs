# Handlebars Editor for Email Notifications

> It's possible to edit the HTML of a Courier Email notification directly using the Handlebars template override.

## Override the Notification Designer With Handlebars

If you want to edit the HTML / Handlebars code of an Email Notification directly, you can switch from the Notification Designer to the Handlebars editor.

:::caution Handlebars Override

The Handlebars toggle will **override** any brands linked to the template. Make sure to include any styling, logo and headers that you want rendered in your Handlebars template. `Open` and `click` tracking are **not available** for Handlebars overrides.

  alt="Create Your Notification"
/>

This is a useful way to import existing HTML templates into Courier.

:::caution Note

Content created using the Handlebars override is not reusable across channels.

:::

If you need to use Handlebars for a portion of your email, use [template blocks](https://help.courier.com/en/articles/4229597-working-with-template-blocks) and combine them with other [block types](https://help.courier.com/en/articles/4193090-content-block-basics) to allow your non-handlebars code content to be re-used in other channels.
<!-- Link follow-up doc -->
Edits made in the Handlebars editor will not apply to other Email notifications. To define the look and feel of all your emails at once, [customize your default brand template](../brands/customize-default-brand.mdx).
