## A Note On Successful Cancellations

A successful cancellation will return a  `200` status code along with the updated `message` record in the response body. Because the cancellation was a success, this `message` record will include a status of `CANCELED` as well as a `canceledAt` timestamp.

This successful response with status code `200` communicates a **_soft guarantee_** of message cancellation. It is still possible that the message has actually already been sent and that the `SENT` event is still on its way and has not been processed yet by the Courier Event Log Service.

## A Note On `:message_id`

A successful call to `POST /send` returns a `202` status code along with a `requestId` in the response body.

For send requests that have a single recipient, the `requestId` is assigned to the derived message as its `message_id`. Therefore the `requestId` can be supplied to the Message’s API for single recipient messages.

For send requests that have multiple recipients (accounts, audiences, lists, etc.), Courier assigns a unique id to each derived message as its `message_id`. Therefore the `requestId` cannot be supplied to the Message’s API for single-recipient messages.
