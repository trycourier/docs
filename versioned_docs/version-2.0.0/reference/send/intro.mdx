# Introduction

The send API lets you send a message to one or more recipients with a single call. Messages are sent asynchronously, so when you call the send API,
the response will contain a request ID that you can use to check the status of your message later.

Recipients come in several forms:
- [User](../profiles/by-id.mdx) - A single user
- [List](../lists/by-id.mdx) - A pre-defined list of users stored with Courier
- [List pattern](../../tutorials/how-to-send-to-a-list-or-list-pattern-using-wildcarding.mdx) - A pattern that can target multiple lists of users at once
- [Audience](../audiences/intro.mdx) - A Courier audience containing users.

**You may also pass an array containing any combination of the above.**

**For ad-hoc users:**

```json
{
    "message": {
        "to": {
            "email": "darth@vader.com",
            "phone_number": "+123456789"
        }
    }
}
```

**For ad-hoc lists:**

```json
{
    "message": {
        "to": [
            {"email": "example1@courier.com"},
            {"email": "example2@courier.com"}
        ]
    }
}
```

There are two styles of notification sending:
- by template
- ad-hoc

To send by template, first create a notification using Courier Studio, then pass the template ID in your send call.
To send ad-hoc, include the content of the notification directly in the send call using Elemental.

## Sending Attachments

To add an attachment, you'll need to first retrieve it from an encoder and convert it to a base64 string. Then you'll be able to add it to the send call using a provider override.

```json
{
   "providers":{
      "sendgrid":{
         "override":{
            "body":{
               "subject":"Requested file - lockheed.json",
               "attachments":[
                  {
                     "content":"eyJmb28iOiJiYXIifQ==", //base64 encoded attachment
                     "type":"application/json",
                     "filename":"lockheed.json"
                  }
               ]
            },
            "config":{
               "apiKey":"<your API Key>"
            }
         }
      }
   }
}
```
