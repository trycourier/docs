# Introduction

The send API lets you send a message to one or more recipients with a single call. Messages are sent asynchronously, so when you call the send API,
the response will contain a request ID that you can use to check the status of your message later.

Recipients come in several forms:
- User - A single user
- List (by ID) - A pre-defined list of users stored with Courier
- List pattern - A pattern that can target multiple lists of users at once
- Audience - A Courier audience containing users.

You may also pass an array containing any combination of the above.

There are two styles of notification sending:
- by template
- ad-hoc

To send by template, first create a notification using Courier Studio, then pass the template ID in your send call.
To send ad-hoc, include the content of the notification directly in the send call using Elemental.
