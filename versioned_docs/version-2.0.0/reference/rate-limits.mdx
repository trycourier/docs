# Rate Limiting

> When and how rate-limits are applied to requests made to the Courier APIs.

## API Rate Limits

### Send API

> Not rate limited

- There are no rate limits on requests made to the [Send API](send/intro.mdx).
- If your send requests occur at a rate that exceeds your provider's rate limit, Courier's Send pipeline will retry your message for 72 hours following these [send retry rules](../sending-notifications/delivery-pipeline-resilience.mdx).

### Profiles API

> Not rate limited

- There is no rate limit on requests made to the [Profiles API](profiles/intro.mdx).
- Some Courier customers like to hit the Profiles API before or after hitting the Send endpoint as part of their Notifications send workflow. The Profiles API is built to scale with this type of workflow.

### Preferences API

> Not rate limited

- There is no rate limit on requests made to the [Preferences API](user-preferences/introduction.mdx).
