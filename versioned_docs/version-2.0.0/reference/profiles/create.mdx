# Create a profile

A `recipient` should be uniquely identifiable using a string ID that will not change. For this reason, you should not use data such as an email address or phone number when assigning a recipient ID. This type of data may change over time.

### More Examples

The following types of requests will not change the body of an existing Profile:

```json title=JSON
// Empty Profile Object
{
  "profile": {}
}
```

The above will result with:

```json title=200
{
  "status": "SUCCESS"
}
```

<ApiReference {...config} />

## Example

Method: `POST`

URL: `https://api.courier.com/profiles/abcdefgh12345678`

Body:
â€‹
```json
{
  "profile": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "phone_number": "555-555-5555"
  }
}
```
