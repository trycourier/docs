# POST /profiles/:recipient_id

A `recipient` should be uniquely identifiable using a string ID that will not change. For this reason, you should not use data such as an email address or phone number when assigning a recipient ID. This type of data may change over time.

### More Examples

The following types of requests will not change the body of an existing Profile:

```json title=JSON
// Empty Profile Object
{
  "profile": {}
}
```

The above will result with:

```json title=200
{
  "status": "SUCCESS"
}
```

<ApiReference {...config} />

## Example
