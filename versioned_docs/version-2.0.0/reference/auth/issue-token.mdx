## Usage

This token can be used as a bearer token in place of a normal API Key for the following endpoints:

- `PUT | PATCH /users/:user_id/tokens/:token` (must have `write:user-tokens` scope).
- `GET /users/:user_id/tokens/:token` (must have `read:user-tokens` scope).
- `GraphQL (POST) /client/q` Required permissions depend on query / mutation.
  - `messages` Requires `read:messages` scope.

Notes:

- Endpoints that are tied to a user_id require the user_id to be listed in the scope field (i.e `user_id:123`)

## Available Scopes

- `user_id:<user-id>` - Gives the token access to a given user. Multiple can be listed. Ex `user_id:pigeon user_id:bluebird`. User ID scopes must be used in conjunction with other scopes to specify which resources of the user the token can access.
- `read:messages` - Gives the token access to read messages. Must be used in conjunction with one or more user_ids.
- `read:user-tokens` - Gives the token access to read user tokens. Must be used in conjunction with one or more `user_id` scopes.
- `write:user-tokens` - Gives the token access to write user tokens. Must be used in conjunction with one or more `user_id` scopes.
- `read:brands[:<brand_id>]` Give the token access to read brands, optionally restricted to a specific brand_id. Examples `read:brands`, `read:brands:my_brand`.
- `write:brands[:<brand_id>]` Give the token access to read brands, optionally restricted to a specific brand_id. Examples `write:brands`, `write:brands:my_brand`.
- `inbox:read:messages` Give the token access to read inbox messages.
- `inbox:write:events` Give the token access to write inbox events, such as mark message as read.
