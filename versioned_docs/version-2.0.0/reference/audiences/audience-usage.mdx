# Usage

Once you define an audience and confirm the rules are including the correct set of users, you can use Send endpoint to send to the audience like this:

```json
{
  "message": {
    "to": {
      "audience_id": "<audience_id>"
    },
    "content": {
      "title": "Hello World",
      "body": "Hello there"
    },
    "routing": {
      "channels": ["push", "sms"],
      "method": "single"
    }
  }
}
```
