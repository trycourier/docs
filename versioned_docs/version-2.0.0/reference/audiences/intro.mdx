# Audiences API

The audience is the collection or segment of users who match the rule criteria. This is useful when developers are tasked to notify a dynamic set of users who fall in a certain bucket. e.g. When a product owner says, we need to build out a notification that sends out billing or usage alerts to all the workspace administrators who are from California. Doing that manually would be a deal-breaker as it requires a lot of work upfront for our developers. We see that problem ourselves and Audiences API is meant to solve this problem.

## Audience structure

```json
{
  "description": "(optional) description for this audience",
  "name": "(optional) name for this audience",
  "filter": {
    "path": "title", // assumes you are using Courier profiles API and your user has title field
    "value": "Software Engineer",
    "operator": "EQ"
  }
}
```

## Audience Filter
Audience filters are used to match a user's profile against a set of criteria. Courier supports the following operators:
- EQ (equal to)
- NEQ (not equal to)
- GT (greater than)
- GTE (greater than or equal to)
- LT (less than)
- LTE (less than or equal to)
- INCLUDES
- OMIT
- AND
- OR

These operators are case-sensitive. Say you create a `user` using Courier's [profile](../../reference/profiles/intro.mdx) and your user's profile looks like this:

```json
{
  "profile": {
    "title": "Software Engineer",
    "email": "suhas@courier.com",
    "phone_number": "1234567890",
    "location": {
      "city": "San Francisco",
      "state": "CA",
      "country": "US"
    },
    "favorite_programming_languages": [
      "Go",
      "Typescript"
    ]
  }
}
```

Now let's consider following use cases and see how we can use them:

### 1. You want to notify a subset of users who are from San Francisco.
```json
{
  "operator": "EQ",
  "path": "location.city",
  "value": "San Francisco"
}
```

### 2. You want to notify a subset of users who are Software Engineer and they either live in San Francisco or Oakland.

```json
{
  "operator": "AND",
  "rules": [
    {
      "operator": "EQ",
      "path": "title",
      "value": "Software Engineer"
    },
    {
      "operator": "OR",
      "rules": [
        {
          "operator": "EQ",
          "path": "location.city",
          "value": "Oakland"
        },
        {
          "operator": "EQ",
          "path": "location.city",
          "value": "San Francisco"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```


### 3. You want to notify a set of users who with title Software Engineer and they have listed Typescript as one of their favorite programming languages.

```json
{
  "operator": "AND",
  "rules": [
    {
      "operator": "EQ",
      "path": "title",
      "value": "Software Engineer"
    },
    {
      "operator": "INCLUDES",
      "path": "favorite_programming_languages",
      "value": "Typescript"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Usage

Once you define a audience, and you confirm the rules are giving you right set of users, you can use [Send endpoint](../../reference/send/message.mdx) to send to the audience like this:

```json
{
  "message": {
    "to": {
      "audience_id": "123456789"
    },
    "content": {
      "title": "Hello World",
      "body": "Hello there"
    },
    "routing": {
      "channels": ["push", "sms"],
      "method": "single"
    }
  }
}

```
