# Audiences API

Audience is an arbitrary user collection that adheres to a set of rules. These rules can be as simple as "users in California," but can also be extended to a complex set of operations. For example, a product owner may need to build out a notification to send billing or usage alerts to workspace administrators who are from California. Doing this manually with Courier requires a lot of tedious work up front, which we want to unload from developers and product teams. The Audiences API is meant to solve this problem by having Courier do all the heavy lifting to make it "just work" for you.

## Audience structure

```json
{
  "description": "(optional) description for this audience",
  "name": "(optional) name for this audience",
  "filter": {
    "path": "title", // assumes you are using Courier profiles API and your user has title field
    "value": "Software Engineer",
    "operator": "EQ"
  }
}
```

## Audience Filter

Audience filters are used to match a user's profile against a set of criteria. Courier supports the following operators:

- EQ (equal to)
- NEQ (not equal to)
- GT (greater than)
- GTE (greater than or equal to)
- LT (less than)
- LTE (less than or equal to)
- INCLUDES
- OMIT
- AND
- OR

These operators are case-sensitive. If a user is created with Courier's [profile](../../reference/profiles/intro.mdx) the user's profile looks like this:

```json
{
  "profile": {
    "title": "Software Engineer",
    "email": "suhas@courier.com",
    "phone_number": "1234567890",
    "location": {
      "city": "San Francisco",
      "state": "CA",
      "country": "US"
    },
    "favorite_programming_languages": ["Go", "Typescript"]
  }
}
```

Now let's consider following use cases and see how we can use them:

### 1. You want to notify a subset of users who are from San Francisco.â€‹

```json
{
  "operator": "EQ",
  "path": "location.city",
  "value": "San Francisco"
}
```

### 2. You want to notify a subset of users who are Software Engineer and they either live in San Francisco or Oakland.

```json
{
  "operator": "AND",
  "filters": [
    {
      "operator": "EQ",
      "path": "title",
      "value": "Software Engineer"
    },
    {
      "operator": "OR",
      "filters": [
        {
          "operator": "EQ",
          "path": "location.city",
          "value": "Oakland"
        },
        {
          "operator": "EQ",
          "path": "location.city",
          "value": "San Francisco"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. You want to notify a set of users who with title Software Engineer and they have listed Typescript as one of their favorite programming languages.

```json
{
  "operator": "AND",
  "filters": [
    {
      "operator": "EQ",
      "path": "title",
      "value": "Software Engineer"
    },
    {
      "operator": "INCLUDES",
      "path": "favorite_programming_languages",
      "value": "Typescript"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Usage

Once you define an audience and confirm the rules are including the correctset of users, you can use Send endpoint to send to the audience like this:

```json
{
  "message": {
    "to": {
      "audience_id": "123456789"
    },
    "content": {
      "title": "Hello World",
      "body": "Hello there"
    },
    "routing": {
      "channels": ["push", "sms"],
      "method": "single"
    }
  }
}
```
