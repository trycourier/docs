# Events API

The Events API allows you to manage your [events](https://www.trycourier.app/settings/event-maps). Events allow you to associate an `event` string passed into the [send command](../../reference/send/message.mdx) with an existing notification.

## Event

The `event` (or sometimes referred to as `event_id`) is a string describing an event. This can be defined by you, i.e. `new-user` or by an incoming integration, i.e. [Segment](https://segment.com/).

## Notification ID

The Notification ID (or `id` in this API) is a unique identifier for a notification created in the [Courier Notification Designer](https://www.trycourier.app/designer/notifications). You can find this id in the notification settings modal by clicking on the gear on next to the notification name.
