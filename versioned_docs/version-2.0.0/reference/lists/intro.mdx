# Lists

The Lists API helps you build lists of [users](/platform/users), which is useful for when you want to easily [send messages to a group](/platform/users#lists-and-audiences). List are defined by subscribing or unsubscribing users to them. This is different from [audiences](/reference/audiences) in which the members of the audience are defined dynamically based on user attributes.
