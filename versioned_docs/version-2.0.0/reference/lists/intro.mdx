# Lists

The Lists API lets you create Lists and subscribe one or more recipient profiles to them in the Courier database. You can send a message to all the recipients you subscribed to that list with a single Send API call.

:::info List_id is not reuseable

A deleted `list_id` can be restored via the [Restore a List API](restore.mdx) and once deleted **cannot be used to create a new list**.
