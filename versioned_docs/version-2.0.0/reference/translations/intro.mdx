# Translations

The Translations API allows you to read/write translations to Courier in the form of .po files (https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/PO-Files.html).

A typical translations workflow would look like:

1. Inserting/Updating a .po file per locale for your workspace
2. Using Courier's `t` handlerbars helper in the notification template where you would like Courier to use translated content. (https://www.courier.com/docs/platform/content/notification-designer/handlebars-helpers/#translate)
3. Courier will look at profile locale and pick up corresponding translation content.
