# Tenants

The Tenants API is designed to enable multi-tenant notification workflows. This is useful for defining user to tenant level relationships, especially in the context of B2B applications.

Use Cases:

- Sending branded notifications on behalf of a tenant
- Creating slack-bots on behalf of a tenant

## Send Call Examples

**Send to a user using the `ACME` tenant as context:**

The notification will be sent using ACME
branding and will load default preferences from the ACME tenant if the user hasn't configured
the notification preferences for themselves.

```js
POST https://api.courier.com/send

{
  message: {
    template: "my_template",
    to: {
      user_id: "person",
    },
    context: {
      tenant_id: "ACME"
    }
  }
}
```

**Send to all members of the ACME tenant:**

The following call address ACME as the recipient of the notification. This will deliver the
notification to all members of ACME.

```js
POST https://api.courier.com/send

{
  message: {
    template: "acme_company_news_letter",
    to: {
      tenant_id: "ACME"
    }
  }
}
```
