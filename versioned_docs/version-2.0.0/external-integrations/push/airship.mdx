# Airship

## Profile Requirements

To deliver a push notification to a recipient over Airship, Courier must be provided the recipient's Airship user id and devices. These values should be included in the recipient profile as `airship`.

```json title=JSON
{
  "message": {
    "template": "{{event.id}}",
    "to": {
      "airship": {
        "audience": {
          "named_user": "{{recipient.user_id}}"
        },
        "device_types": ["ios"]
      }
    },
    "data": {
      "username": "Steph Courier"
    }
  }
}
```

## Override

You can use a provider override to replace what we send to Airship's API. For example, you can use basic auth with your send request:

```json title=JSON
{
  "message": {
    "template": "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ",
    "to": {
      "airship": {
        "audience": {
          "named_user": "{{recipient.user_id}}"
        },
        "device_types": ["ios"]
      }
    },
    "data": {
      "dataForPushMessage": true
    },
    "providers": {
      "airship": {
        "override": {
          "body": {},
          "headers": {
            "Authorization": "Basic {{EncodedAppKey:AppSecret}}"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Everything inside of `providers.airship.override` will replace what we send to Airship's API. You can see all the available options by visiting [Airship's website](https://docs.airship.com/api/ua/).

## Tracking Events

Courier will include tracking URL information in the `global_attributes` [data bag](https://www.notion.so/trycourier/Tracking-Push-events-d6fdb9015da44ae5a6acdc5fe6832571#04de2c636307494fad517a24d9a9dd40).
