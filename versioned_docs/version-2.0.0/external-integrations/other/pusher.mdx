# Pusher

## Profile Requirements

To deliver a message to a recipient via Pusher, Courier must be provided a target object that contains the recipient's pusher channel. This value should be included in the recipient profile as 'pusher'.

```json title=JSON
{
  "message": {
    // Recipient Profile
    "to": {
      "pusher": {
        "channel": "<PUSHER_CHANNEL>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Template Requirements

Pusher can be used in Courier in two ways. One is via the "Push" channel the other is via a direct Pusher channel. When in the direct Pusher channel, a jsonnet editor will be provided for you to customize your payload. When Pusher is integrated via the push channel, a rich editor will be shown.

## Example Event

```json title=JSON
{
  "message": {
    "template": "<COURIER_NOTIFICATION_ID>",
    "to": {
      "pusher": {
        "channel": "<PUSHER_CHANNEL>"
      }
    },
    "data": {
      "name": "Katherine Pryde"
    }
  }
}
```

## Tracking Events

Courier will include tracking URL information in the `data` attribute on the incoming message payload.
