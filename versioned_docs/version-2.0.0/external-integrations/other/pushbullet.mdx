# Pushbullet

## Profile Requirements

No profile data is required for Pushbullet.

## Override

Overrides can be used to change the request body that Courier uses to send a push message. Overrides are useful when a field is not yet supported by Courier or you would like to override the value that Courier generates. You can override any of the fields supported by Pushbulletâ€™s `/pushes` endpoint ([see all send request body fields here](https://docs.pushbullet.com/#create-push)).

Below is an example using the override to send a `url` by overriding the `type` of the push:

```json title=JSON
{
  "message": {
    "template": "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ",
    "to": {},
    "providers": {
      "pushbullet": {
        "override": {
          "body": {
            "type": "link",
            "url": "https://www.courier.com"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
