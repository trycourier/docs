## Profile Requirements

To deliver a message to a recipient over Vonage (formally Nexmo), Courier must be provided the recipient's SMS-compatible telephone number. Be sure that all phone numbers include country code, area code, and phone number without spaces or dashes. This value should be included in the recipient profile as `phone_number`.

```json title=JSON
{
  "message": {
    // Recipient Profile
    "to": {
      "phone_number": "+491575556511"
    }
  }
}
```
