# Email Providers

Courier integrates with many different email providers, as well as SMTP. In order for a recipient to receive an email notification, their user profile must include an email address in the `email` property.

```json
// Recipient Profile
{
  "email": "support@courier.com"
}
```

## Email Channel Overrides


Use the email channel override property to override channel settings such as subject, reply to, from, cc, and bcc email addresses, along with HTML and text content. These overrides will apply to all your email channels within a template.

:::info Overrides

Overrides occur **after** the render step in the notification lifecycle. This means the the rendered tab in the logs page **will not show** the end result for a notification that was rendered with overrides.

:::

**Data structure for the email channel override:**

```json
{
  "message": {
    // ...rest of request
    "channels": {
      "email": {
        "override": {
          "attachments": [],
          "bcc": "",
          "brand": {},
          "cc": "",
          "from": "",
          "html": "",
          "reply_to": "",
          "subject": "",
          "text": "",
          "tracking": {
            "open": false
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Brand override

The `channels.email.override.brand` property uses same schema as the API request payload for the [POST&nbsp;/brands](../../reference/brands/create-a-brand.mdx) endpoint.

Brand elements that can be overridden:

- logo
- top bar color
- brand colors

**Example:
**

```json
{
  "message": {
    // ...rest of request
    "channels": {
      "email": {
        "override": {
          "brand": {
            "settings": {
              "email": {
                "header": {
                  "logo": {
                    "image": "https://www.courier.com/logo.png",
                    "href": "https://www.courier.com"
                  },
                  "barColor": "#674ea7"
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Allowlist for AWS IP Addresses

Some email providers, such as Mailgun, offer [additional security](https://help.mailgun.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012244474-IP-Allowlist) to allowlist IP addresses to access their API. Courier is hosted on AWS and does not provide an IP range in the form of an allowlist.

As a workaround, users can subscribe to the `AmazonIpSpaceChanged` topic, and receive notifications about any changes to the AWS IP address ranges. For details, refer to the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-ip-ranges.html#subscribe-notifications).
