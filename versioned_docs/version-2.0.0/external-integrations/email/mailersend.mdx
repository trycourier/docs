# MailerSend

## Profile Requirements

To deliver a message to a recipient over MailerSend, Courier must be provided the recipient's email address. This value should be included in the recipient profile as `email`.

```json title=JSON
{
  "message": {
    // Recipient Profile
    "to": {
      "email": "example@example.com"
    }

    // ... rest of message definition
  }
}
```

## Authentication Token Generation

First you need to add your domain and verify it.

Click on “Manage” button and in the following screen generate an authentication token

## Override

Overrides can be used to change the request body that Courier uses to send an email. Overrides are useful when a field is not yet supported by Courier or you would like to override the value that Courier generates. You can override any of the fields supported by MailerSend's `https://api.mailersend.com/v1/email` endpoint ([see all mail send request body fields here](https://developers.mailersend.com/api/v1/email.html#send-an-email). Below is an example of overriding the subject:

```json title=JSON
{
  "message": {
    "template": "<COURIER_NOTIFICATION_ID>",
    "profile": {
      "email": "hello@courier.com"
    },
    "data": {
      "name": "Abdul Ahmady"
    },
    "providers": {
      "mailersend": {
        "override": {
          "config": {
            "apiKey": "<YOUR_OVERRIDDEN_API_KEY>",
            "fromAddress": "<YOUR_OVERRIDDEN_From_ADDRESS>",
            "url": "<YOUR_OVERRIDDEN_URL>"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## MailerSend 422 Response Code

When submitting an API request to MailerSend, you will get a numbered response code. One of the most common response error codes is a [422 error](https://www.mailersend.com/help/how-to-start-sending-emails#rest-api). This could be due to a couple of reasons:

<table><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>From email must be verified</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>The domain of the from email address must match the domain that the API token or SMTP credentials are from.</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>You must provide HTML and/or text versions of the email or template ID.</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>The API request is missing one of the 3 parameters needed to send the content, either the text or HTML version or the template ID. </p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>This file type is not supported.</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>The attachment file encoded in Base 64 is not part of MailerSend supported filetypes. Please refer to <a target="_blank" title="supported file types" href="https://developers.mailersend.com/api/v1/email.html#supported-file-types">supported file types here</a>.</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>The reply to email must be a valid email address.</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>The reply_to email parameter is not a valid email address, it may be missing an "@", make sure it's a valid email address without typos.</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Email quota reached</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>The account's quota has been reached. Make sure your account has been approved so you can send more than 100 emails per month.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

Among these errors, the most common one our users encounter is the email domain verification. Please make sure your email domain is [verified with MailerSend](https://www.mailersend.com/help/how-to-verify-and-authenticate-a-sending-domain) before you start using it in your Courier integration.
