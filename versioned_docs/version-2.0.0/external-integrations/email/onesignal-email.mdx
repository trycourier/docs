You can get your OneSignal `App ID` and `REST API Key` by following [these instructions](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/accounts-and-keys).

## Profile Requirements

To deliver a message to a recipient over OneSigal, Courier must be
provided the recipient's [PlayerId](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/users#section-player-id) or [ExternalId](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/user-model-migration-guide#user-model). This ID should be included in the recipient profile as `oneSignalPlayerID` or `oneSignalExternalUserId`.
