# Segment API

## Identify Calls

Segment Identify calls allow you to connect a user to their actions (Segment events) and record traits to them - the user can be identified by their User ID and can hold additional traits such as their name, email, etc.

[Learn more about Segment Identify >](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/identify/)

### Recipients

Courier recipients can be updated using Segment user profiles over time.

## Track Calls

Segment Track calls allow you to record actions performed by your users, including any properties associated with their actions - the actions can be associated with any properties that help you analyze these actions.

Track events appear with a prefix of `track/` in Courier. Courier gathers data from the track's `properties` object - to send notifications based on a Segment event, these track events must be mapped to Courier Automations.

The following is an example Segment API call:

```jsx
analytics.track('Login Button Clicked', {
  messageId: "segment-test-message-a8rmf",
  timestamp: "2021-12-07T08:41:59.410Z",
  type: "track",
  email: "test@example.org",
  projectId: "4GgKeBoVJkT9EZL4vAmduv",
  properties: {
    property1: 1,
    property2: "test",
    property3: true
  },
  userId": "test-user-cqw3gr",
  event": "Segment Test Event Name"
})
```

The following is the associated JSON object from the Segment API call:

```json
{
  "messageId": "segment-test-message-a8rmf",
  "timestamp": "2021-12-07T08:41:59.410Z",
  "type": "track",
  "email": "test@example.org",
  "projectId": "4GgKeBoVJkT9EZL4vAmduv",
  "properties": {
    "property1": 1,
    "property2": "test",
    "property3": true
  },
  "userId": "test-user-cqw3gr",
  "event": "Segment Test Event Name"
}
```

The following is how the above JSON object is mapped into the Courier data object:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "property1": 1,
    "property2": "test",
    "property3": true
  }
}
```

**Troubleshooting:**

If the email property isnâ€™t being read into Courier, try to place `email` within the `properties` object.
