# Courier as a Segment Source

You can configure Courier to send events to your Segment integration, allowing you to track Courier events in Segment.

## Setting Up Courier as a Segment Source

1. In Segment, navigate to the *Sources* page (under "Connections").
2. Select your framework of choice (e.g., Node.js).
3. Obtain a write key. After adding Node.js as a source, you'll see a page with instructions on how to add Segment to your Node.js codebase. 
Copy the write key from this page.
4. In Courier's Segment configuration, paste your [Segment Write Key](https://segment.com/docs/connections/find-writekey/) in the *Segment write key* input field.

After adding your Segment write key, Courier will send updates to Segment. Update events include messages being sent, opened, clicked, delivered, unroutable, and undeliverable.

When Courier is set up as a Segment source, the following events can be tracked in Segment:

### Message Events
- `Message Clicked`
- `Message Delivered`
- `Message Opened`
- `Message Sent`
- `Message Undeliverable`
- `Message Unroutable`

### Audience Events
