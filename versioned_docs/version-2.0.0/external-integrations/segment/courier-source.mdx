## From Segment

1. In Segment, navigate to the Sources page (under “Connections”).
2. Select your framework of choice (e.g. Node.js).
3. Get a write key.

:::tip Write Key

Once you've added Node.js as a source, you'll see a page with instructions on how to add Segment to your Node.js codebase. You'll be given a write key, which you can copy.

4. Insert your [Segment Write Key](https://segment.com/docs/connections/find-writekey/) in the Segment source write key input in Courier Studio.
5. *Click away from the input field* to save and the value will be masked like below.

After adding your Segment write key, Courier will send updates to Segment. 
Update events include messages being sent, opened, clicked, delivered, unroutable, and undeliverable.

## Inside Courier

These events will also be forwarded to Courier, if you've set it as a destination

You can then use these events to map other automations
