# Event trigger

You can trigger events either via the sources you connected or by directly calling rudderstack endpoints.

Courier destination supports `identify` and `track` events, which appear on Courier Rudderstack integration page inside Courier Studio UI.

Check <a href="https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-node-sdk/#sending-events">this</a> to learn more on sending events to your RudderStack instance.

Once events start flowing in from RudderStack into Courier, those appear on RudderStack integration page on Courier Studio.

## Supported events

### Identify

RudderStack identify event when sent to Courier creates or updates the user profile. It uses userId as the user identifier and the `traits` get mapped to user profile attributes.

### Track

RudderStack track event when sent to Courier can trigger an automation or supply inline automations payload. The `properties` used inside the payload will be used for mapping it to Courier.

## Event mapping

Received RudderStack Events can be mapped to an existing automation, or a new automation can be initialized where the event is set as a trigger.

Click on the plus (+) icon under link automations and map the event to an existing automation template, or create a new automation template.

Properties should be scoped by courier.automation object, so for instance if you want to map userId to refs, your request to rudderstack would look like below (note courier.automation object):

```json title="Rudderstack Courier Automation Property Example"
{
  "event": "user-checkout",
  "type": "track",
  "properties": {
    "courier": {
      "automation": {
        "data": {
          "userId": "my-user"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Mapped automation would look like below:
