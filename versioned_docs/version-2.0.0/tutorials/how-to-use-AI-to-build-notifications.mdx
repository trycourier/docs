# How to Use AI to Build Notifications

Courier's AI content generator (backed by best-in-class GPT-3 models) lets you build and iterate on notification content rapidly.

## Creating New Notifications

### Using an Intuitive Notification Title

The title you use for the new notification would be an input to the AI which will determine the generated content. Enter a notification title and check the Use AI checkbox.

Examples of titles you can use:

- Password Reset Request
- Login Verification
- Subscribe to Our Newsletter
- Forgot Password
- Upgrade Pricing Tier
- Add Your Social Media
- Free Tier Limit Exceeded
- New Feature Launch

### Generated Notification

The Courier AI content generator will build a notification with multiple text blocks and email channel by default. You can add a provider or switch to a channel of your choosing.

## Editing Notification Content

You can use the AI to edit notification content using the content generator toolbar.

### AI Bulb Icon

A text block toolbar includes a bulb icon which opens an AI content generator modal. You can use this modal to dictate the prompt for the AI to use for your content.

### Prompt the AI to Generate Content

Insert a prompt which provides some context to the AI. Then click `Generate Content`.

### Adding Content to the Notification

You can use the generated content as is, or edit it to best fit your use case. Click `Add Content` to apply your desired content on the text block.

Your text block content will be replaced with the AI-generated content. You can keep exploring with the AI generator as many times as you'd like, or update the content directly.
