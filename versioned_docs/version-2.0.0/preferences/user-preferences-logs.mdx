# User Preference Logs

> Courier tracks when your users update their notification preferences and logs the changes in the "Preferences Logs" section of a users page in Courier.

With Courier Preferences, your users can exert fine-grained control over the notifications they receive. To track which changes to preferences your users have made, we created User Preference Logs.

User preference logs track all preference changes made by your users, regardless of where you've integrated Courier Preferences.

To find these logs, navigate to Courier's "Preferences Logs" section of a user's page.
