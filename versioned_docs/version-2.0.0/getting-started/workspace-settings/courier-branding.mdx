# Removing Courier Branding

> How to upgrade and remove the "Powered by Courier" branding.

## Removing the Courier Watermark

If you'd like to remove the Courier branding from your emails, you can upgrade to any of our paid plans, like our self-serve Developer Plan which start at $0.005 per send. 

Just have your workspace owner head to the billing page in the app and select your preferred plan.

### Update Your Payment Method

You can upgrade to the self-serve Developer Tier, or [reach out to our Product Experts](https://www.courier.com/request-demo/) if your use case fits our Courier Business plan.
