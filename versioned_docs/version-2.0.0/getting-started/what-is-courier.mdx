# What is Courier?

> A high-level introduction to Courier and how it helps you design and deliver user notifications across multiple channels.

Courier lets you design your notifications once and deliver them to any channel-push notifications, direct messages, SMS, and email-with a single [Courier API](../reference/intro.mdx) rather than having to integrate each provider API separately.

## What Can I Do With Courier?  

If you send notifications to users via [email](../guides/providers/email/intro.mdx), push, [SMS](../guides/providers/sms/intro.mdx), or [direct message](../guides/providers/direct-message/intro.mdx), you can use Courier to:

### Design Notification Content

Courier's [Notification Designer](../courier-designer/notification-designer/notification-designer-overview.mdx) empowers every team member to build beautiful notifications.

- Drag & drop content without writing code.
- Consistent rendering across every email client.
- Re-use content for any channel.
- Consistent branding across all your notifications.

###  Build Powerful Delivery Rules

Route each message to the most effective notification channel using a robust [delivery rules engine](../sending-notifications/channel-priority.mdx) without touching your code.

- Drag and drop channel prioritization.
- Always send settings.
- "Best of" channel settings.

### Track Cross-Channel Delivery

Courier [Data Logs](https://help.courier.com/en/articles/4364860-using-the-data-logs) and Metrics give you insight into your notification performance across all channels.

- Find the best channel for each user.
- Compare deliverability across multiple providers.
- Detailed event log for every user on every channel.
