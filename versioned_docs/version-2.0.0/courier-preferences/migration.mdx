## Changes to your unsubscribe link

With the launch of Courier Preferences we're upgrading the unsubscribe link in your emails to a new UI and linking existing user preferences to Courier subscription topics.
For each notification template that one of your recipients has unsubscribed from, Courier has created a matching subscription topic in Courier Preferences.
Existing preferences for users will still be respected after this migration.

## Migrating from Categories

Courier is slowly depreciating the use of categories in notification templates in favor of Courier Preferences.
Courier Preferences takes the best parts of categories but adds a lot more flexibility and control and with this migration,
your existing categories preferences will still work as you've set them.
For each category you've created, we've created a matching subscription topic in Courier Preferences.
The topic we've created matches the default state of the category so if you had a category that was enabled by default, the topic will be enabled by default.
Recipient preferences attached to categories will still be respected.

## Migrating from old Preferences

For users of old Courier Preferences, we've migrated your preferences to the new Courier Preferences.
Your preference templates still exist, but are now attached to a section. All your preference temtplate settings
have been migrated for you.
