# How to Send a Notification with Quick Send

## What is Quick Send?

Quick Send is a product feature that enables a one time send to be crafted and sent to your users in under 5 minutes.

## How to Send a Message with Quick Send

### Creating Content to Send

First, start by creating content that you’d wish to send to your users. Enter a title and a message to send. You may also decide
what language you want this content to be displayed as by using the drop down menu shown below.

Here, you can also choose to bold or italicize your message as well.

### Branding

Your default brand will only be present within Quick Send.


### Adding a Button

You can also add a button to your message and customize its title.

/>

For the Button URL, “https://” is not required. For instance, “courier.com” is acceptable as a URL.

### Adding Tags

Tags allow for more visibility within logs. To add a tag, simply type the name of the tag you’d wish to add, then hit “return”/”enter” key on your keyboard or click “create [tag name]” within the dropdown that appears.

/>

Here, we’ll add a tag named “Welcome”.

/>

You can now see the tag has been successfully added.

### Adding Data to Your Message

Adding data to your message is possible through JSON. For example, you can create variables and use them throughout your message. 
Here’s an example of a welcome message using variables like title, date, and name.

/>

This data must then be encapsulated by double curly braces as shown.

<Image

/>

This data will be populated when previewing your Quick Send message, as shown below.

### Adding Data to Your Message

Quick Send allows you to add any of the following three recipient types: User, List, or Audience. Use the dropdown menu to see what Users, Lists, or Audiences are present within your workspace. 

Each dropdown option will display their name and ID.

Quick Send requires that you have Users, Lists, or Audiences created prior to using Quick Send. There is no ability to create a recipient within this feature.

### Configuring Routing Options

<Image

Every Quick Send message requires routing to be properly configured. This means adding a channel to both sections, “Always sent to” and “Send to the best of”. When clicking on “Add Channel”, you will see the following.

<Image
  img={require("../../assets/guides/tutorials/image12.png")}
/>

Select whichever channel you want for your notification. For the sake of this example, we’ll choose the “Email” option. After making this selection, we see the following.

<Image
  img={require("../../assets/guides/tutorials/image13.png")}
/>

Now that we’ve selected this channel, we must add a configured provider. Clicking on this channel will give us channel options/settings. 

<Image
  img={require("../../assets/guides/tutorials/image14.png")}
/>

Click on “Add Provider”, which will give you the following module view.

<Image
  img={require("../../assets/guides/tutorials/image15.png")}
/>

Select a provider you’d like to use. For this example, we will use “Gmail”. Lastly, don’t forget to click “Save Changes” before clicking outside of this module to save your changes that you just made.

<Image

/>

Now, click “Add Channel” under “Send to the best of”.

<Image
  img={require("../../assets/guides/tutorials/image17.png")}
/>

For this example, the “Email” option is chosen once more, and an “Email" channel will automatically add/configure the provider that was recently configured. For this example, we used “Gmail”. We see that an “Email” channel with “Gmail” as a provider was automatically configured under the “Send to the best of” section of our routing settings. 

<Image
  img={require("../../assets/guides/tutorials/image18.png")}
/>

This is just one example, showing how “Email”, configured with “Gmail” works. However, there are many options to choose from in terms of channels and providers to send a message with Quick Send.

### How to Preview a Message

In order to preview, ensure that you add a recipient.

Ensure that you select a recipient. Once you do this, you will have the ability to see how said recipient will receive your Quick Send message.

Click on “Send Notification” to send your Quick Message to your recipient(s).
