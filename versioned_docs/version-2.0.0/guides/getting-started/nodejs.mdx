# Get Started with Node.js

Welcome to the Node.js Quickstart! Here we will walk through the process of getting your API keys, installing the SDK, and making your first API call with Node.js. If you have any questions, join our Discourse community: [https://forum.courier.com/](https://forum.courier.com/)

## Prerequisites

- [Sign up for Courier](https://app.courier.com/)
- [Integrate the provider for the type of notification you want to](https://youtu.be/nAbRLOMv96w)
- Install the latest version of Node.js: [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Getting Your API Keys

Navigate to the Courier API Keys page in Settings (https://app.courier.com/settings/api-keys) to get access to all API keys, including production and test keys. [Learn more about the difference between production and test keys >](https://forum.courier.com/t/the-difference-between-production-and-test-environments/115)

## Using the SDK

### Installing the SDK

Run the following command in your project directory to install the SDK via npm:

```
npm install @trycourier/courier
```

### Sending a notification with Courier Elemental

Courier Elemental is a new JSON syntax built to describe your notification, including recipient data, notification content, variables, and routing. Here is an example of a simple notification sent with Elemental:

```jsx
import { CourierClient } from "@trycourier/courier";
// alternatively:
// const { CourierClient } = require("@trycourier/courier");

const courier = CourierClient({ authorizationToken: "YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN_HERE" });

const { requestId } = await courier.send({
  message: {
    to: {
      email: "email@example.com",
    },
    content: {
      title: "Welcome!",
      body: "Thanks for signing up, {{name}}",
    },
    data: {
      name: "Peter Parker",
    },
    routing: {
      method: "single",
      channels: ["email"],
    },
  },
});
```

Replace the JSON within the body to match the type and content of notification you want to send.

There are 4 main properties within this example notification:

- `to`: provide information used by Courier to identify the recipient of the notification. Here you can include details such as the recipient’s email address for email, phone number for SMS.
- `content`: add your notification’s title and body.
- `data`: include any data you want to pass to a message template. The data will populate the corresponding template variables.
- `routing`: customize which channel(s) Courier will potentially deliver the message. If no routing key is specified, Courier will use the default routing configured in the Courier Studio UI.

### Create a Notification: In the Designer

This is **optional**, and only recommended when you want to use the Courier app to design a notification. Once you have designed the notification template in the Courier Designer, you can replace the JSON body with the following:

```json
{
  "message": {
    "to": {
      "email": "email@example.com"
    },
    //Notification ID can be found in the template settings in the Courier Designer
    "template": "a-courier-notification-id-or-event-mapping"
  }
}
```

### Send & Test the Notification

Sending a message is an async process. So upon submission of a message, only a requestId will be returned.

```json
{ "requestId": "87e7c05b-4f46-fda24e356e23" }
```

Monitor the status of your notification once sent in the Courier app's [Data Dashboard](https://app.courier.com/data/messages).
