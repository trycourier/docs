# Webhook Integration

Courier supports sending HTTP requests to a specified destination using the Webhook provider.

## Profile Requirements

To deliver an HTTP request, Courier must be provided with a destination. For a static destination, you can specify the Webhook URL and Authorization type in the [webhook integration setup page](https://www.trycourier.app/integrations/webhook).

### Dynamic Destination

If you need to specify the webhook destination on a per recipient basis, you can choose "Dynamic Destination" and pass the information in the recipient profile. These values should be included in the recipient profile as `webhook`.

```json title=JSON
{
  "message": {
    // Recipient Profile
    "to": {
      "webhook": {
        "url": "https://www.example.com",
        "method": "POST", // default to "POST",
        "headers": {
          "Content-Type": "application/json"
        },
        "authentication": {
          "mode": "basic", //default to "none"
          "username": "AzureDiamond",
          "password": "hunter2"
        },
        "profile": "expanded" // default to "limited"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Authentication

The webhooks provider supports basic and bearer authentication. You can select either type by setting `authentication.method` to `basic` or `bearer` and providing the credentials. Authentication defaults to `None` if not provided.

```json title="Basic Auth"
{
  "mode": "basic", //default to "none"
  "username": "AzureDiamond",
  "password": "hunter2"
}
```

```json title="Bearer Auth"
{
  "mode": "bearer",
  "token": "ABCDEFG123456"
}
```

#### Expanded Profile

What profile information is included in the request payload can be specified by setting `profile` to either `limited` or `expanded` . The default setting is `limited` and will only included the profile data provided when the send API was called. Selecting `expanded` will include profile data merged from the profile database.

## Request Payload

Based on how the profile is configured, the webhook provider will send the following payload using what was passed into the send method.

```json title=JSON
// Example Payload
{
  "message": {
    "template": "MY_EVENT",
    "to": {
      "email": "stan.pines@mysteryshack.com",
      "phone_number": "+12025550165"
    },
    "data": {
      "name": "Stan Pines",
      "location": "Gravity Falls, OR"
    }
  }
}
```

## Override

You can use a provider override to replace what we send to the destination.

```json title=JSON
{
  "message": {
    "template": "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ",
    "data": {
      "hello": "world"
    },
    "providers": {
      "webhook": {
        "override": {
          "url": "https://www.example.com",
          "method": "PUT",
          "headers": {
            "X-Custom-Header": "Hello from Courier"
          },
          "body": {
            "key": "value"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
