# Africa's Talking

## Profile Requirements

To deliver a message to a recipient over Africa's Talking SMS, Courier must be provided the recipient's SMS-compatible telephone number. This value should be included in the recipient profile as `phone_number`.

```json title=JSON
// Recipient Profile
{
  "message": {
    "to": {
      "phone_number": "+27765559758"
    }
  }
}
```

## Override

You can use a provider override to replace what we send to Africa's Talking SMS API. For example, you can add a registered short code or alphanumberic from you Africa's Talking SMS Application to your request:

```json title=JSON
{
  "message": {
    "template": "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ",
    "to": {
      "phone_number": "+27765559758"
    },
    "providers": {
      "africastalking-sms": {
        "override": {
          "body": {
            "from": "12345"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Everything inside of `providers.africastalking-sms.override` will replace what we send to Africa's Talking SMS API. You can see all the available options by visiting [Africa's Talking SMS docs](https://build.at-labs.io/docs/sms%2Fsending).
