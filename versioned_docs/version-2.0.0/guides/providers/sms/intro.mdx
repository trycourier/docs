# SMS Providers

Courier supports a number of SMS Providers. In order to send a notification using an SMS Channel, the recipient profile must include an SMS capable phone number in the `phone_number` property.

```json
// Recipient Profile
{
  "message": {
    "to": {
      "phone_number": "+12025550156"
    }
  }
}
```
