# Azure SMS

## Profile Requirements

To deliver an SMS message through Azure SMS, Courier must be provided the recipient's SMS-compatible phone number. This value should be included in the recipient profile as `phone_number`.

```json title=JSON
{
  "message": {
    // Recipient Profile
    "to": {
      "phone_number": "+11112223334"
    }
  }
}
```

## Overrides

Overrides can be used to change the request that Courier makes to the provider. Overrides are useful when a field is not yet supported by Courier or you would like to override the value that Courier generates. You can override the `authToken`, `from` and `email` as well as the `body` of the SMS content.

```json title=JSON
{
  "message": {
    "template": "<COURIER_NOTIFICATION_ID>",
    "to": {
      "phone_number": "+12345678901"
    },
    "data": {
      "first_name": "Jane Doe"
    },
    "providers": {
      "azure-sms": {
        "override": {
          "body": {
            "to": "+19876543210",
            "message": "I am the right content for the SMS"
          },
          "config": {
            "from": "<override from number>",
            "accessKey": "<override access key>",
            "endpoint": "<override endpoint>"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
