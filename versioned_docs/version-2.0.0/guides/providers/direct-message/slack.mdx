# Set Up Chat Using Slack

## Slack App Requirements

To send notifications via Slack, a Slack App is required. You may use an existing or [create a new basic app](https://api.slack.com/authentication/basics).

### Scopes

The Slack App must be granted the `chat:write` scope. Additional scopes may be required based on the type of message you send. You can modify scopes by selecting the Slack App from [Your Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) and clicking “OAuth & Permissions” from the side menu.

### Bot User OAuth Access Token

In order to send a message on behalf of your Slack App using Courier, a Bot User Oauth Access Token will need to be passed in the recipient profile. We’ll refer to this token as the `access_token`. You can find this token by selecting the Slack App from [Your Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) and clicking “OAuth & Permissions” from the side menu.

:::tip Helpful tip
The bot access token will always start with `xoxb-`.
:::

## Profile Requirements

The information required in the recipient profile is different based on the type of message you are sending.

### Sending a Direct Message

To send a message to a user, you’ll need to specify the user along with `access_token`. There are 3 ways to do this.

:::caution Additional Scopes Required
Sending Direct Messages requires an additional scope. Be sure to grant the `im:write` scope to your Slack App.
:::

#### Use the Slack Button

Slack’s [Slack Button](https://api.slack.com/docs/slack-button) lets you easily connect your Slack App with your customer’s account. As part of the OAuth process that the Slack Button initiates, Slack will fire a webhook to your servers. Simply store what they send you for that user and send it along to Courier, we’ll take care of the rest.

```json title=JSON
{
  "message": {
    // Recipient Profile
    "to": {
      "slack": {
        // Contents of the JSON object provided by Slack's OAuth access method
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Using the email associated with Slack

To simplify setting up the recipient profile, we allow you to specify the `email` used to log into the Slack Workspace and Courier will do the `user_id` lookup for you.

```json title=JSON
{
  "message": {
    // Recipient Profile
    "to": {
      "slack": {
        "access_token": "xoxb-xxxxx",
        "email": "user@example.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

:::caution Additional Scopes Required
Using this method requires additional scopes. Be sure to grant the `users:read` and `users:read.email` scopes to your Slack App.
:::

#### Using `user_id`

For testing, the `user_id` is found by finding the user in the Workspace Directory, clicking the … button, and selecting “Copy member ID”. For production use cases you would likely retrieve these IDs via the Slack API.

```json title=JSON
{
  "message": {
    // Recipient Profile
    "to": {
      "slack": {
        "access_token": "xoxb-xxxxx",
        "user_id": "UEFNTF6QL"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

:::tip Helpful tip
A `user_id` will always start with a `U` or `W`.
:::

### Sending to a Public or Private Channel

:::caution Additional Scopes Required
To send to a public channel your app isn't a member of, be sure to grant your Slack app the `chat:write.public` scope.
:::

To send a message to a public or private channel, you’ll need to pass its `channel` along with the `access_token`. The easiest way to get this value is to open Slack in a browser, navigate to the desired channel and copy it from the URL.

<Image
  img={require("../../../assets/guides/providers/slack-channel-id.png")}
  alt="Locating the channel in the Slack web client."
/>

```json title=JSON
{
  "message": {
    // Recipient Profile
    "to": {
      "slack": {
        "access_token": "xoxb-xxxxx",
        "channel": "CL2MR6HEX"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In the event that you don't have direct access to the Slack Workspace, you can also retrieve the channel ids using the [`conversations.list`](https://api.slack.com/methods/conversations.list) method of the Slack Web API using the `access_token`. Be sure to request the `channels:read` scope.

Here is an example that will fetch all public Slack Channels for a workspace and create a Courier Profile for each one using the [Courier Node.js SDK](https://github.com/trycourier/courier-node).

```js
const { CourierClient } = require("@trycourier/courier");
const { WebClient } = require("@slack/web-api");

// Courier Access Token is stored in COURIER_ACCESS_TOKEN environment variable
const courier = CourierClient();
// SLACK TOKEN must be granted channels:read scope
const web = new WebClient(process.env.SLACK_TOKEN);

const main = async () => {
  // Fetch all public channels for Slack Workspace
  const { channels } = await web.conversations.list({
    types: "public_channel",
    exclude_archived: true,
  });

  // Create a Courier Profile for each channel
  for (let channel of channels) {
    const { id, name } = channel;
    const recipientId = `CHANNEL_${name.toUpperCase()}`;
    try {
      await courier.replaceProfile({
        recipientId,
        profile: {
          slack: {
            access_token: process.env.SLACK_TOKEN,
            channel: id,
          },
        },
      });
      console.log(`${recipientId}: Profile saved for channel ${name}`);
    } catch (ex) {
      console.log(`Error saving profile for channel: ${name}`, ex);
    }
  }
};

main();
```

This will allow you to send to a channel using a user id of `CHANNEL_` + the channel name in all upper case .If you wanted to send a message to the general channel, it would look like the following:

```json title=JSON
{
  "message": {
    "to": {
      "user_id": "CHANNEL_GENERAL"
    },
    "template": "HELLO_SLACK",
    "data": {
      "hello": "world"
    }
  }
}
```

:::tip Helpful Tips

- A `channel` will always start with a `C`.
- Before you can send to a channel, your Slack app must be invited into it.

### Responding to a Slash Command

If you are working with a [Slash Command](https://api.slack.com/interactivity/slash-commands) and would like to respond to it, you can use the `response_url` from the [POST payload](https://api.slack.com/interactivity/slash-commands#app_command_handling). This URL can be passed to Courier as a Slack Incoming Webhook.

```json title=JSON
{
  "message": {
    // Recipient Profile
    "to": {
      "slack": {
        "incoming_webhook": {
          "url": "https://hooks.slack.com/commands/1234/5678"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

:::note Setting the `response_type`
Slash Command responses can either be sent as `in_channel` or `ephemeral`. You can set this using an override. Set `override.slack.body.response_type` to either `in_channel` or `ephemeral` in the `POST /send` payload. The default is `ephemeral`.
:::

Since the POST payload also contains the `channel_id` and `user_id`, you may also respond using the methods above. However, you will need to also use the `access_token`, make sure the proper scopes are applied, and make sure your app is in the channel if you are responding in channel.

### Incoming Webhooks

Incoming Webhooks are a simple way to post messages from your app to a specific public channel. Unless you have a specific use case, we recommend sending using one of the methods outlined above. Follow the [Incoming Webhooks Setup Guide](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) and pass the Webhook URL via `slack.incoming_webhook.url` to the recipient profile.

```json title=JSON
{
  "message": {
    // Recipient Profile
    "to": {
      "slack": {
        "incoming_webhook": {
          "url": "https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Order of Precedence

The Slack profile should only contain an OAuth Response, Incoming Webhook, or the `access_token` and one of the following: `channel`, `user_id`, or `email`. If there are multiples, the order of precedence is as follows: `channel` > `user_id` > `email`. For example, if your profile is as follows:

```json title=JSON
{
  "message": {
    "to": {
      "slack": {
        "access_token": "xoxb-xxxxx",
        "channel": "CL2MR6HEX",
        "user_id": "UEFNTF6QL"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The notification will be sent using the `channel`.

:::tip Helpful Tips

We look for `channel`, `user_id`, or `email` in the incoming request to decide what channel to send the notifications to, and our logic is as follow:

- if `channel` is provided in the request, we just use `channel`.
- if `channel` is missing but `user_id` is provided in the request, we use `user_id`.
- if `channel` and `user_id` are missing but `email` is provided in the request, we use `email` to derive the `channel`

:::

## Override

You can use a provider override to replace what we send to Slack’s [chat.postMessage](https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage) method. For example, you can choose to have links unfurl.

```json title=JSON
{
  "message": {
    "template": "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ",
    "to": {
      "slack": {
        "access_token": "xoxb-xxxxx",
        "user_id": "UEFNTF6QL"
      }
    },
    "providers": {
      "slack": {
        "override": {
          "body": {
            "unfurl_links": true
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Common Uses

### Mentioning Users

You can mention users in a Slack message using the syntax `<@USER_ID>` in a Notification Designer Block. You can also use a variable to set the Slack User ID.

### Legacy Profile Format

When the Courier Slack Integration first launched, the profile data was accepted in a different format. While it is recommended that you use the format outlined above, the following profile format may still work for some Slack Apps.

```json title=JSON
{
  "message": {
    // Recipient Profile
    "to": {
      "slackToken": "xoxb-xxxxx",
      "slackChannel": "CL2MR6HEX"
    }
  }
}
```
