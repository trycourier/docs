# Airship

## Profile Requirements

To deliver a push notification to a recipient over Airship, Courier must be provided the recipient's Airship user id and devices. These values should be included in the recipient profile as `airship`.

```json title=JSON
{
  "event": "{{event.id}}",
  "recipient": "{{recipient.id}}",
  "profile": {
    "airship": {
      "audience": {
        "named_user": "{{recipient.user_id}}"
      },
      "device_types": ["ios"]
    }
  },
  "data": {
    "username": "Steph Courier"
  }
}
```

## Override

You can use a provider override to replace what we send to Airship's API. For example, you can use basic auth with your send request:

```json title=JSON
{
  "event": "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ",
  "recipient": "abc123",
  "profile": {
    "airship": {
      "audience": {
        "named_user": "{{recipient.user_id}}"
      },
      "device_types": ["ios"]
    }
  },
  "data": {
    "dataForPushMessage": true
  },
  "override": {
    "airship": {
      "body": {},
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Basic {{EncodedAppKey:AppSecret}}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Everything inside of `override.airship` will replace what we send to Airship's API. You can see all the available options by visiting [Airship's website](https://docs.airship.com/api/ua/).
