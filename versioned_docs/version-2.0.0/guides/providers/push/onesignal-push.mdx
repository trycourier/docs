# OneSignal Push

## Configuration Requirements

You can get your OneSignal `App ID` and `REST API Key` by following [these instructions](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/accounts-and-keys).

## Profile Requirements

To deliver a message to a recipient over OneSigal, Courier must be
provided the recipient's [PlayerId](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/users#section-player-id). This ID should be included in the recipient profile as `oneSignalPlayerID`. Courier does not yet support OneSignal's External IDs.

```json title=JSON
// Recipient Profile
{
  "oneSignalPlayerID": ""
}
```
