# Postmark

## Profile Requirements

To deliver a message to a recipient over Postmark, Courier must be provided the recipient's email address. This value should be included in the recipient profile as `email`.

```json title=JSON
{
  "message": {
    // Recipient Profile
    "to": {
      "email": "example@example.com"
    }

    // ... rest of message definition
  }
}
```

## Override

You can use a provider override to replace what we send to Postmark's Email API. For example, you can add [MessageStream](https://postmarkapp.com/support/article/1207-how-to-create-and-send-through-message-streams) and an attachment to your request:

```json title=JSON
{
  "message": {
    "template": "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ",
    "to": {
      "email": "example@example.com"
    },
    "providers": {
      "postmark": {
        "override": {
          "config": {
            "MessageStream": "message_stream_id"
          },
          "body": {
            "Attachments": [
              {
                "Name": "readme.txt",
                "Content": "dGVzdCBjb250ZW50",
                "ContentType": "text/plain"
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `message.porviders.postmark.override` property can be used to replace what we send to Postmark's Email API. Note: the override does not replace the entire object, only the elements that you define in the body of the override. You can see all the available options by visiting the [Postmark API docs](https://postmarkapp.com/developer/api/email-api).
