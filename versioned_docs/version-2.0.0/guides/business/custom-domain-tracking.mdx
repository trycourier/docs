# Custom Domain Tracking

By default, Courier uses `ct0.app` for link tracking. Courier business tier customers can opt for custom tracking domain (ex: tracking.mywebsite.com) if interested!

## Setting up custom tracking

While we are planning on making this a self-served process soon, at the moment it requires you working with Courier Support.

### Provide us the tracking URL

This would typically be something like `tracking.mywebsite.com`

### Modifying DNS entries

This step requires adding 2 new DNS records on your end.

a. First one is for cert validation. Based on your tracking URL, Courier will create a certificate and ask you to confirm/validate.
This cert is required so our infrastructure allows requests redirected from you during tracking resolution. Work with Courier support staff to get this added.

b. Second one is adding `tracking.mywebsite.com` CNAME `tracking.ct0.app`

### Go live

After updating the DNS records, work with Courier support who will enable this feature for you. Once enabled, all links would be routed through your tracking domain.
