# Analytics

Courier's business tier customers get access to the Analytics dashboard. See stats for notifications (sent, delivered, opened, clicked, errors, etc.) with the ability to filter per channel with customized time windows and date ranges. We currently support template-level analytics that lets you gain insights on Send volume and Channel performances.

## Template Analytics (Notification metrics)

This feature gives granular statistical data points on a particular template. You can visually infer how a notification template is performing across multiple channels through a particular time range.
