# Okta Integration

## Introduction

This guide will walk you through the steps necessary to allow your team to sign in to Courier with Okta.

## Prerequisites

- An Okta account with Admin privileges.
- Each user must be invited to courier via email before they can log in with Okta.
- Some of these steps require information to be received from _and_ sent to courier. Before continuing, contact Courier support and ask for assistance in setting up Okta Sign in.

## Set Up

1. Navigate to the Applications > Applications section of the Okta admin panel
2. Hit the "Create App Integration Button":

  (Name format can be left as `Unspecified`)

7. Hit the "Next" button towards the bottom of the page

That's all thats needed to allow sign in with Okta. Be sure to assign users using the Assignments tab of Courier App Integration.

## Migrating Users To Okta

1. From the [Settings > Security](https://app.courier.com/settings/security) page, Ensure that "Require Google SSO" is not checked

Note: If users were already assigned to the Courier app before provisioning was setup, you will need to edit their assignment and update their role.

Provisioning is now enabled. Changes to user assignments in the Courier Okta app will automatically be reflected in the Courier Workspace. Users will receive an invite via email to Courier when added. They are automatically removed from the Courier Workspace when no longer assigned in Okta.
