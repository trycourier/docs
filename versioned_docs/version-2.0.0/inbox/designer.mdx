# Using a Template

Instead of defining the content of the entire notification in-line, you can leverage Templates to send a message. 

You can create  notification templates using the [Designer](https://app.courier.com/designer). After you create a template (or edit an existing one), add a new channel and select "Inbox". This will provide you with a blank template that you can use to customize the content that will delivered with that notification.

Note: pinning is not available in the mobile (iOS and Android) SDKs.

:::

When calling the API, simply replace the `content` field with a `template` field that defines either a Template ID or an Event ID. 

```json
{
	"message": {
		"to": {
			"user_id": <USER_ID>
		},
		"template": <TEMPLATE ID or EVENT ID>,
		"data": {
			"villian": "Darth Vader"
		}
		"routing": {
			"method": "single",
			"channels": ["inbox"]
		}
	}
}
```

Information in `data` will be passed through, but requires "data mapping" inside of the template's channel settings to pass through to the SDK.
