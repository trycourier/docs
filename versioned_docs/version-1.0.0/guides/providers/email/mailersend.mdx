# MailerSend

## Profile Requirements

To deliver a message to a recipient over MailerSend, Courier must be provided the recipient's email address. This value should be included in the recipient profile as `email`.

```json title=JSON
// Recipient Profile
{
  "email": "example@example.com"
}
```

## Authentication Token Generation

First you need to add your domain and verify it.

## Override

Overrides can be used to change the request body that Courier uses to send an email. Overrides are useful when a field is not yet supported by Courier or you would like to override the value that Courier generates. You can override any of the fields supported by MailerSend's `https://api.mailersend.com/v1/email` endpoint ([see all mail send request body fields here](https://developers.mailersend.com/api/v1/email.html#send-an-email). Below is an example of overriding the subject:

```json title=JSON
{
  "event": "<COURIER_NOTIFICATION_ID>",
  "recipient": "abdul_ahmady",
  "profile": {
    "email": "hello@courier.com"
  },
  "data": {
    "name": "Abdul Ahmady"
  },
  "override": {
    "mailersend": {
      "config": {
        "apiKey": "<YOUR_OVERRIDDEN_API_KEY>",
        "fromAddress": "<YOUR_OVERRIDDEN_From_ADDRESS>",
        "url": "<YOUR_OVERRIDDEN_URL>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
