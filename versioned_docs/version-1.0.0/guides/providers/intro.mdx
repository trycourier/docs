# Introduction

Courier allows you to design and send notifications across four different communication channels: Email, Push, SMS, and Direct Message. For each channel, Courier integrates with many of the widely used providers.

Sending a notification requires a `profile`, which can be sent inline or retrieved using the `recipientId`. [Channel Rules](../../reference/vocabulary#channel-rules) use this profile information to prioritize where with which Channel and Integration a notification is sent.

The "Profile Requirements" for each integration are available in the menu to the left organized by Channel.
