# SMS Providers

Courier supports a number of SMS Providers. In order to send a notification using an SMS Channel, the recipient profile must include an SMS capable phone number in the `phone_number` property.

```json
// Recipient Profile
{
  "phone_number": "+12025550156"
}
```

Learn more about specific SMS Integrations by selecting them on the left.
