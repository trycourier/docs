# Twilio

## Profile Requirements

To deliver a message to a recipient over Twilio, Courier must be provided the recipient's SMS-compatible phone number. This value should be included in the recipient profile as `phone_number`.

```json title=JSON
// Recipient Profile
{
  "phone_number": "+12345678901"
}
```

## Overrides

Overrides can be used to change the request body that Courier uses to send an SMS message. Overrides are useful when a field is not yet supported by Courier or you would like to override the value that Courier generates. You can override any of the fields supported by Twilio's `Messages.json` endpoint ([see all send request body fields here](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/api/message-resource#create-a-message-resource)). Below is an example of overriding the to phone number and the account SID + auth token for the configuration:

```json title=JSON
{
  "event": "<COURIER_NOTIFICATION_ID>",
  "recipient": "katherine_pryde",
  "profile": {
    "phone_number": "+12345678901"
  },
  "data": {
    "name": "Katherine Pryde"
  },
  "override": {
    "twilio": {
      "body": {
        "to": "+109876543210"
      }
    },
    "config": {
      "accountSid": "<your Account SID>",
      "authToken": "<your Auth Token>",
      "messagingServiceSid": "<your Messaging Service SID>"
    }
  }
}
```
