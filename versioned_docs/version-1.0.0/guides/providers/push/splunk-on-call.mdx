# Splunk On Call

## Profile Requirements

To deliver a message to a recipient over Splunk On-Call, Courier must be provided a target object that contains the recipient's type and slug. This value should be included in the recipient profile as `splunk_on_call`.

```json title=JSON
//RecipientProfile
{
  "splunk_on_call": {
    "target": {
      "type": "User",
      "slug": "userSlug"
    }
  }
}
```

## Template Requirements

To deliver a message to a recipient over Splunk On-Call, Courier must be provided a summary in the notificationâ€™s integration settings

## Override

Overrides can be used to change the request body that Courier uses to send a push message. Overrides are useful when a field is not yet supported by Courier or you would like to override the value that Courier generates. You can override any of the fields supported by Splunk On-Call's `/api-public/v1/incidents` endpoint ([see all send request body fields here](https://portal.victorops.com/public/api-docs.html#/Incidents)). Below is an example of overriding the from username and the api key for the configuration:

```json title=JSON
{
  "event": "<COURIER_NOTIFICATION_ID>",
  "recipient": "katherine_pryde",
  "profile": {
    "splunk_on_call": {
      "target": {
        "type": "User",
        "slug": "kpryde"
      }
    }
  },
  "data": {
    "name": "Katherine Pryde"
  },
  "override": {
    "config": {
      "apiKey": "<your API Key>",
      "userName": "<youruserName>"
    }
  }
}
```
