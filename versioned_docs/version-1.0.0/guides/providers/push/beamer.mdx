# Beamer

## Profile Requirements

No profile data is required for Beamer.

## Override

Overrides can be used to change the request body that Courier uses to send a push message. Overrides are useful when a field is not yet supported by Courier or you would like to override the value that Courier generates. You can override the following fields from Beamerâ€™s `postcreation` object ([documented here in Beamer's API docs](https://www.getbeamer.com/api#definition-PostCreation)).

```json
{
  "filter": "",
  "filterUserId": "",
  "filterUrl": "",
  "sendPushNotification": "",
  "publish": ""
}
```

Below is an example of using the override to deliver a post to a specific known user id.

```json title=JSON
{
  "override": {
    "beamer": {
      "body": {
        "filterUserId": "YOUR USER ID",
        "sendPushNotification": "false",
        "publish": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
