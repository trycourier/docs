# Ops Genie

## Profile Requirements

No profile data is required for Ops Genie. If the Channel is included in your notification template, it will be routed.

```json title=JSON
// Recipient Profile
{}
```

## Override

Overrides can be used to change the request body that Courier uses to send a push message. Overrides are useful when a field is not yet supported by Courier or you would like to override the value that Courier generates.

**Note:** If you are using it in Europe region, be sure to https://api.eu.opsgenie.com/v2 and the apiKey tied to your EU region.

```json title=JSON
{
  "override": {
    "opsgenie": {
      "config": {
        "accessToken": "YOUR TOKEN",
        "url": "URL"
      },
      "headers": {},
      "body": {
        "message": "YOUR MESSAGE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
