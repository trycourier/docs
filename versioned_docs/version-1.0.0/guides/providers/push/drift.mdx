# Drift

## Profile Requirements

To start a conversation with a recipient over Drift, Courier must be provided the recipient's email. This value should be included in the recipient profile as `email`.

```json title=JSON
//RecipientProfile
{
  "email": "example@example.com"
}
```

## Override

Overrides can be used to change the request body that Courier uses to send an email. Overrides are useful when a field is not yet supported by Courier or you would like to override the value that Courier generates. You can override any of the fields supported by Drift’s `/conversations/new` endpoint ([see all send request body fields here](https://devdocs.drift.com/docs/creating-a-conversation)). Below is an example of overriding the “send to" email and the access token for the configuration:

```json title=JSON
{
  "event": "<COURIER_NOTIFICATION_ID>",
  "recipient": "katherine_pryde",
  "profile": {
    "phone_number": "+12345678901"
  },
  "data": {
    "name": "Katherine Pryde"
  },
  "override": {
    "drift": {
      "body": {
        "from": "+109876543210"
      }
    },
    "config": {
      "accessToken": "<youraccesstoken>"
    }
  }
}
```
