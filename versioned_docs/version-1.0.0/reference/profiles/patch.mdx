# PATCH /profiles/:recipient_id

Unlike a `PUT` request, a `PATCH` request will update only a portion of a recipient's profile. `PATCH` syntax is a little more complicated. Courier uses the [JSON Patch](http://jsonpatch.com/) syntax described below.

Imagine that we have a profile with an `email` and `phone_number`. We want to update only the email address.

```json
"profile": {
  "email": "normanosborn@oscorp.com",
  "phone_number": "555-555-5555",
}
```

Our patch request body will be JSON. The first key in a JSON Patch object will be `op`, which stands for the _operation_ you are to perform. This is assigned a value of `add`, `remove`, `replace`, `move`, `copy`, or `test`. We already have an email address present, so we will use `replace`.

We list the value to be replaced by pointing to it using the `path` key. This `path` takes a value pointing to the key we want to target. The path is built using "/" characters. Our `email` key is one level deep, so we will use `"/email"`. We then have a `value` key that is assigned the value we want to replace our existing email with. The entire line looks like this:

```json
{ "op": "replace", "path": "/email", "value": "test@example.com" }
```

To send the `PATCH` request, we send an array with our JSON Patch objects.

```json
[{ "op": "replace", "path": "/email", "value": "test@example.com" }]
```

If you want to update multiple values, your patch will look like this:

```json
[
  { "op": "replace", "path": "/email", "value": "test@example.com" },
  { "op": "replace", "path": "/phone_number", "value": "test@example.com" }
]
```

### More Examples

The following types of requests will not change the body of an existing Profile:

```json title=JSON
// Empty Patch Array
{
  "patch": []
}
```

The above will result with:

```json title=200
{
  "status": "SUCCESS"
}
```
