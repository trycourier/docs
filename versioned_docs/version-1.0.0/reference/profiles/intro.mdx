# Profiles API

The Profiles API allows you to manage the profile information associated with an individual recipient.

## Recipient ID

A `recipient_id` is a unique identifier for a recipient. This can be any string of your choosing. Be sure to choose a value that does not change. This prevents duplicate entries in the event that a recipient changes their email or some other identifying value. Typically, user ID values from your system make for good recipient_id's.

## Profile

A `profile` is a JSON object that includes any key-value pairs required by our Integrations. You can find the required keys for any Integration on its "Integrations" page. See the ["Integration Introduction"](doc:integrations-introduction) for details.

```json
"profile": {
  "phone_number": "555-555-5555",
  "email”: “normanosborn@oscorp.com"
}
```
