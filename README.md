## Writing API Reference Documentations

API Reference component can be embedded into any `.mdx` documentation file, you just need to render a <ApiReference /> component anywhere in the doc you want it to be shown.

It's best to keep the options that are being passed to in a separate `.ts` file so that it's possible to typecheck it with TypeScript. The file can be imported and the props be passed from that file.
